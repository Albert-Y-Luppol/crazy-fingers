that they were perfectly normal,\nthank you very much. They were the last people you\u2019d\nexpect to be involved in anything strange or\nmysterious, because they just didn\u2019t hold with such\nnonsense.\n\nMr. Dursley was the director of a firm called\nGrunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy\nman with hardly any neck, although he did have a\nvery large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and\nblonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of\nneck, which came in very useful as she spent so\nmuch of her time craning over garden fences, spying\non the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son\ncalled Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer\nboy anywhere.\n\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they\nalso had a secret, and their greatest fear was that\nsomebody would discover it. They didn\u2019t think they\ncould bear it if anyone found out about the Potters.\nMrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley\u2019s sister, but they hadn\u2019t\n\nPage | 2 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\nmet for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended\nshe didn\u2019t have a sister, because her sister and her\ngood-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it\nwas possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think\nwhat the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in\nthe street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a\nsmall son, too, but they had never even seen him.\n\nThis boy was another good reason for keeping the\nPotters away; they didn\u2019t want Dudley mixing with a\nchild like that.\n\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray\nTuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the\ncloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and\nmysterious things would soon be happening all over\nthe country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out\nhis most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley\ngossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming\nDudley into his high chair.\n\nNone of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past\nthe window.\n\nAt half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his\nbriefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and\ntried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because\nDudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his\ncereal at the walls. \u201cLittle tyke,\u201d chortled Mr. Dursley\nas he left the house. He got into his car and backed\nout of number four\u2019s drive.\n\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the\nfirst sign of something peculiar \u2014 a cat reading a\nmap. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn\u2019t realize what he\nhad seen \u2014 then he jerked his head around to look\nagain. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner\nof Privet Drive, but there wasn\u2019t a map in sight. What\ncould he have been thinking of? It must have been a\ntrick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at\nPage | 3 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nthe cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around\nthe corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his\nmirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet\nDrive \u2014 no, looking at the sign; cats couldn\u2019t read\nmaps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake\nand put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward\ntown he thought of nothing except a large order of\ndrills he was hoping to get that day.\n\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his\nmind by something else. As he sat in the usual\nmorning traffic jam, he couldn\u2019t help noticing that\nthere seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people\nabout. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn\u2019t bear\npeople who dressed in funny clothes \u2014 the getups\nyou saw on young people! He supposed this was some\nstupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the\nsteering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these\nweirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering\nexcitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see\nthat a couple of them weren\u2019t young at all; why, that\nman had to be older than he was, and wearing an\nemerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it\nstruck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly\nstunt \u2014 these people were obviously collecting for\nsomething ... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved\non and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the\nGrunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\n\nMr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in\nhis office on the ninth floor. If he hadn\u2019t, he might\nhave found it harder to concentrate on drills that\nmorning. He didn\u2019t see the owls swooping past in\nbroad daylight, though people down in the street did;\nthey pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after\nowl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an\nowl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a\nperfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five\ndifferent people. He made several important telephone\nPage | 4 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\ncalls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good\nmood until lunchtime, when he thought he\u2019d stretch\nhis legs and walk across the road to buy himself a\nbun from the bakery.\n\nHe\u2019d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he\npassed a group of them next to the baker\u2019s. He eyed\nthem angrily as he passed. He didn\u2019t know why, but\nthey made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering\nexcitedly, too, and he couldn\u2019t see a single collecting\ntin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a\nlarge doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words\nof what they were saying.\n\n\u201cThe Potters, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s what I heard \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201c \u2014 yes, their son, Harry \u2014 \u201d\n\nMr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He\nlooked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say\nsomething to them, but thought better of it.\n\nHe dashed back across the road, hurried up to his\noffice, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him,\nseized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing\nhis home number when he changed his mind. He put\nthe receiver back down and stroked his mustache,\nthinking ... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn\u2019t\nsuch an unusual name. He was sure there were lots\nof people called Potter who had a son called Harry.\nCome to think of it, he wasn\u2019t even sure his nephew\nwas called Harry. He\u2019d never even seen the boy. It\nmight have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no\npoint in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so\nupset at any mention of her sister. He didn\u2019t blame\nher \u2014 if he\u2019d had a sister like that ... but all the\nsame, those people in cloaks ...\n\n\n\nPage | 5 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nHe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that\nafternoon and when he left the building at five o\u2019clock,\nhe was still so worried that he walked straight into\nsomeone just outside the door.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled\nand almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr.\nDursley realized that the man was wearing a violet\ncloak. He didn\u2019t seem at all upset at being almost\nknocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split\ninto a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that\nmade passersby stare, \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, my dear sir,\nfor nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-\nKnow-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like\nyourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy\nday!\u201d\n\nAnd the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the\nmiddle and walked off.\n\nMr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been\nhugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he\nhad been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was\nrattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home,\nhoping he was imagining things, which he had never\nhoped before, because he didn\u2019t approve of\nimagination.\n\nAs he pulled into the driveway of number four, the\nfirst thing he saw \u2014 and it didn\u2019t improve his mood \u2014\nwas the tabby cat he\u2019d spotted that morning. It was\nnow sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the\nsame one; it had the same markings around its eyes.\n\n\u201cShoo!\u201d said Mr. Dursley loudly.\n\nThe cat didn\u2019t move. It just gave him a stern look.\n\nWas this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered.\nTrying to pull himself together, he let himself into the\n\nPage | 6 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nhouse. He was still determined not to mention\nanything to his wife.\n\nMrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told\nhim over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door\u2019s problems\nwith her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new\nword (\u201cWon\u2019t!\u201d). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally.\nWhen Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the\nliving room in time to catch the last report on the\nevening news:\n\n\u201cAnd finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported\nthat the nation\u2019s owls have been behaving very\nunusually today. Although owls normally hunt at\nnight and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have\nbeen hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in\nevery direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to\nexplain why the owls have suddenly changed their\nsleeping pattern.\u201d The newscaster allowed himself a\ngrin. \u201cMost mysterious. And now, over to Jim\nMcGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more\nshowers of owls tonight, Jim?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Ted,\u201d said the weatherman, \u201cI don\u2019t know about\nthat, but it\u2019s not only the owls that have been acting\noddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire,\nand Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that\ninstead of the rain I promised yesterday, they\u2019ve had a\ndownpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have\nbeen celebrating Bonfire Night early \u2014 it\u2019s not until\nnext week, folks! But I can promise a wet night\ntonight.\u201d\n\nMr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars\nall over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious\npeople in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a\nwhisper about the Potters . . .\n\n\n\nPage | 7 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nMrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two\ncups of tea. It was no good. He\u2019d have to say\nsomething to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \u201cEr\n\u2014 Petunia, dear \u2014 you haven\u2019t heard from your sister\nlately, have you?\u201d\n\nAs he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and\nangry. After all, they normally pretended she didn\u2019t\nhave a sister.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cFunny stuff on the news,\u201d Mr. Dursley mumbled.\n\u201cOwls . . . shooting stars . . . and there were a lot of\nfunny-looking people in town today ...\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d snapped Mrs. Dursley.\n\n\u201cWell, I just thought ... maybe ... it was something to\ndo with ... you know ... her crowd.\u201d\n\nMrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr.\nDursley wondered whether he dared tell her he\u2019d\nheard the name \u201cPotter.\u201d He decided he didn\u2019t dare.\nInstead he said, as casually as he could, \u201cTheir son \u2014\nhe\u2019d be about Dudley\u2019s age now, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose so,\u201d said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his name again? Howard, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking\nhorribly. \u201cYes, I quite agree.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t say another word on the subject as they\nwent upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the\nbathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window\n\nPage | 8 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nand peered down into the front garden. The cat was\nstill there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though\nit were waiting for something.\n\nWas he imagining things? Could all this have\nanything to do with the Potters? If it did ... if it got out\nthat they were related to a pair of \u2014 well, he didn\u2019t\nthink he could bear it.\n\nThe Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep\nquickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over\nin his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell\nasleep was that even if the Potters were involved,\nthere was no reason for them to come near him and\nMrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and\nPetunia thought about them and their kind. ... He\ncouldn\u2019t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up\nin anything that might be going on \u2014 he yawned and\nturned over \u2014 it couldn\u2019t affect them. ...\n\nHow very wrong he was.\n\nMr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy\nsleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no\nsign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue,\nits eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet\nDrive. It didn\u2019t so much as quiver when a car door\nslammed on the next street, nor when two owls\nswooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight\nbefore the cat moved at all.\n\nA man appeared on the corner the cat had been\nwatching, appeared so suddenly and silently you\u2019d\nhave thought he\u2019d just popped out of the ground. The\ncat\u2019s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\n\nNothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet\nDrive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the\nsilver of his hair and beard, which were both long\n\nPage | 9 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nenough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long\nrobes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and\nhigh-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light,\nbright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles\nand his nose was very long and crooked, as though it\nhad been broken at least twice. This man\u2019s name was\nAlbus Dumbledore.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore didn\u2019t seem to realize that he had\njust arrived in a street where everything from his\nname to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy\nrummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But\nhe did seem to realize he was being watched, because\nhe looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still\nstaring at him from the other end of the street. For\nsome reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse\nhim. He chuckled and muttered, \u201cI should have\nknown.\u201d\n\nHe found what he was looking for in his inside\npocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He\nflicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it.\nThe nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He\nclicked it again \u2014 the next lamp flickered into\ndarkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer,\nuntil the only lights left on the whole street were two\ntiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of\nthe cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their\nwindow now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they\nwouldn\u2019t be able to see anything that was happening\ndown on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-\nOuter back inside his cloak and set off down the\nstreet toward number four, where he sat down on the\nwall next to the cat. He didn\u2019t look at it, but after a\nmoment he spoke to it.\n\n\u201cFancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 10 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nHe turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone.\nInstead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking\nwoman who was wearing square glasses exactly the\nshape of the markings the cat had had around its\neyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one.\nHer black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She\nlooked distinctly ruffled.\n\n\u201cHow did you know it was me?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cMy dear Professor, I\u2019ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be stiff if you\u2019d been sitting on a brick wall all\nday,\u201d said Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cAll day? When you could have been celebrating? I\nmust have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my\nway here.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\n\n\u201cOh yes, everyone\u2019s celebrating, all right,\u201d she said\nimpatiently. \u201cYou\u2019d think they\u2019d be a bit more careful,\nbut no \u2014 even the Muggles have noticed something\u2019s\ngoing on. It was on their news.\u201d She jerked her head\nback at the Dursleys\u2019 dark living-room window. \u201cI\nheard it. Flocks of owls ... shooting stars. ... Well,\nthey\u2019re not completely stupid. They were bound to\nnotice something. Shooting stars down in Kent \u2014 I\u2019ll\nbet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much\nsense.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t blame them,\u201d said Dumbledore gently.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven\nyears.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that,\u201d said Professor McGonagall irritably.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s no reason to lose our heads. People are\nbeing downright careless, out on the streets in broad\n\nPage | 11 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\ndaylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes,\nswapping rumors.\u201d\n\nShe threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore\nhere, as though hoping he was going to tell her\nsomething, but he didn\u2019t, so she went on. \u201cA fine\nthing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who\nseems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found\nout about us all. I suppose he really has gone,\nDumbledore?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt certainly seems so,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cWe have\nmuch to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon\ndrop?\u201d\n\n\u201cA what?\u201d\n\n\u201cA lemon drop. They\u2019re a kind of Muggle sweet I\u2019m\nrather fond of.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d said Professor McGonagall coldly, as\nthough she didn\u2019t think this was the moment for\nlemon drops. \u201cAs I say, even if You-Know-Who has\ngone \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Professor, surely a sensible person like\nyourself can call him by his name? All this You-\nKnow-Who\u2019 nonsense \u2014 for eleven years I have been\ntrying to persuade people to call him by his proper\nname: Voldemort.\u201d Professor McGonagall flinched, but\nDumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops,\nseemed not to notice. \u201cIt all gets so confusing if we\nkeep saying You-Know-Who.\u2019 I have never seen any\nreason to be frightened of saying Voldemort\u2019s name.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know you haven\u2019t,\u201d said Professor McGonagall,\nsounding half exasperated, half admiring. \u201cBut you\u2019re\ndifferent. Everyone knows you\u2019re the only one You-\nKnow- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\u201d\n\nPage | 12 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou flatter me,\u201d said Dumbledore calmly. \u201cVoldemort\nhad powers I will never have.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOnly because you\u2019re too \u2014 well \u2014 noble to use\nthem.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lucky it\u2019s dark. I haven\u2019t blushed so much since\nMadam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall shot a sharp look at\nDumbledore and said, \u201cThe owls are nothing next to\nthe rumors that are flying around. You know what\neveryone\u2019s saying? About why he\u2019s disappeared?\n\nAbout what finally stopped him?\u201d\n\nIt seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the\npoint she was most anxious to discuss, the real\nreason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all\nday, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she\nfixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she\ndid now. It was plain that whatever \u201ceveryone\u201d was\nsaying, she was not going to believe it until\nDumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore,\nhowever, was choosing another lemon drop and did\nnot answer.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re saying,\u201d she pressed on, \u201cis that last\nnight Voldemort turned up in Godric\u2019s Hollow. He\nwent to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and\nJames Potter are \u2014 are \u2014 that they\u2019re \u2014 dead.\u201d\n\nDumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall\ngasped.\n\n\u201cLily and James ... I can\u2019t believe it ... I didn\u2019t want to\nbelieve it ... Oh, Albus ...\u201d\n\nDumbledore reached out and patted her on the\nshoulder. \u201cI know ... I know ...\u201d he said heavily.\n\nPage | 13 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nProfessor McGonagall\u2019s voice trembled as she went\non. \u201cThat\u2019s not all. They\u2019re saying he tried to kill the\nPotters\u2019 son, Harry. But \u2014 he couldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t\nkill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but\nthey\u2019re saying that when he couldn\u2019t kill Harry Potter,\nVoldemort\u2019s power somehow broke \u2014 and that\u2019s why\nhe\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nDumbledore nodded glumly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s true?\u201d faltered Professor McGonagall. \u201cAfter\nall he\u2019s done ... all the people he\u2019s killed ... he couldn\u2019t\nkill a little boy? It\u2019s just astounding ... of all the\nthings to stop him . . . but how in the name of heaven\ndid Harry survive?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can only guess,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cWe may\nnever know.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief\nand dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles.\nDumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden\nwatch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very\nodd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers;\ninstead, little planets were moving around the edge. It\nmust have made sense to Dumbledore, though,\nbecause he put it back in his pocket and said,\n\u201cHagrid\u2019s late. I suppose it was he who told you I\u2019d be\nhere, by the way?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t\nsuppose you\u2019re going to tell me why you\u2019re here, of all\nplaces?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle.\nThey\u2019re the only family he has left now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean \u2014 you can\u2019t mean the people who\nlive here?\u201d cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her\n\nPage | 14 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nfeet and pointing at number four. \u201cDumbledore \u2014 you\ncan\u2019t. I\u2019ve been watching them all day. You couldn\u2019t\nfind two people who are less like us. And they\u2019ve got\nthis son \u2014 I saw him kicking his mother all the way\nup the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter\ncome and live here!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best place for him,\u201d said Dumbledore firmly.\n\u201cHis aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything\nto him when he\u2019s older. I\u2019ve written them a letter.\u201d\n\n\u201cA letter?\u201d repeated Professor McGonagall faintly,\nsitting back down on the wall. \u201cReally, Dumbledore,\nyou think you can explain all this in a letter? These\npeople will never understand him! He\u2019ll be famous \u2014\na legend \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if today was\nknown as Harry Potter Day in the future \u2014 there will\nbe books written about Harry \u2014 every child in our\nworld will know his name!\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Dumbledore, looking very seriously\nover the top of his half-moon glasses. \u201cIt would be\nenough to turn any boy\u2019s head. Famous before he can\nwalk and talk! Famous for something he won\u2019t even\nremember! Can\u2019t you see how much better off he\u2019ll be,\ngrowing up away from all that until he\u2019s ready to take\nit?\u201d\n\n\n\nProfessor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her\nmind, swallowed, and then said, \u201cYes \u2014 yes, you\u2019re\nright, of course. But how is the boy getting here,\nDumbledore?\u201d She eyed his cloak suddenly as though\nshe thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.\n\n\u201cHagrid\u2019s bringing him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think it \u2014 wise \u2014 to trust Hagrid with\nsomething as important as this?\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 15 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI would trust Hagrid with my life,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying his heart isn\u2019t in the right place,\u201d said\nProfessor McGonagall grudgingly, \u201cbut you can\u2019t\npretend he\u2019s not careless. He does tend to \u2014 what\nwas that?\u201d\n\nA low rumbling sound had broken the silence around\nthem. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and\ndown the street for some sign of a headlight; it\nswelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky \u2014\nand a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed\non the road in front of them.\n\nIf the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man\nsitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a\nnormal man and at least five times as wide. He looked\nsimply too big to be allowed, and so wild \u2014 long\ntangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his\nface, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his\nfeet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In\nhis vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of\nblankets.\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \u201cAt\nlast. And where did you get that motorcycle?\u201d\n\n\u201cBorrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,\u201d said the\ngiant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he\nspoke. \u201cYoung Sirius Black lent it to me. I\u2019ve got him,\nsir.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo problems, were there?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir \u2014 house was almost destroyed, but I got him\nout all right before the Muggles started swarmin\u2019\naround. He fell asleep as we was flyin\u2019 over Bristol.\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 16 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nDumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward\nover the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a\nbaby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair\nover his forehead they could see a curiously shaped\ncut, like a bolt of lightning.\n\n\u201cIs that where \u2014 ?\u201d whispered Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cHell have that scar forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t you do something about it, Dumbledore?\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if I could, I wouldn\u2019t. Scars can come in handy.\n\nI have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect\nmap of the London Underground. Well \u2014 give him\nhere, Hagrid \u2014 we\u2019d better get this over with.\u201d\n\nDumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned\ntoward the Dursleys\u2019 house.\n\n\u201cCould I \u2014 could I say good-bye to him, sir?\u201d asked\nHagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry\nand gave him what must have been a very scratchy,\nwhiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl\nlike a wounded dog.\n\n\u201cShhh!\u201d hissed Professor McGonagall, \u201cyou\u2019ll wake the\nMuggles!\u201d\n\n\u201cS-s-sorry,\u201d sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted\nhandkerchief and burying his face in it. \u201cBut I c-c-\ncan\u2019t stand it \u2014 Lily an\u2019 James dead \u2014 an\u2019 poor little\nHarry off ter live with Muggles \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, it\u2019s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself,\nHagrid, or we\u2019ll be found,\u201d Professor McGonagall\nwhispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as\nDumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and\nwalked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the\nPage | 17 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\ndoorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it\ninside Harry\u2019s blankets, and then came back to the\nother two. For a full minute the three of them stood\nand looked at the little bundle; Hagrid\u2019s shoulders\nshook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and\nthe twinkling light that usually shone from\nDumbledore\u2019s eyes seemed to have gone out.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Dumbledore finally, \u201cthat\u2019s that. We\u2019ve no\nbusiness staying here. We may as well go and join the\ncelebrations.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, \u201cI\u2019d best\nget this bike away. G \u2019night, Professor McGonagall \u2014\nProfessor Dumbledore, sir.\u201d\n\nWiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid\nswung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the\nengine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off\ninto the night.\n\n\u201cI shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\u201d\nsaid Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor\nMcGonagall blew her nose in reply.\n\nDumbledore turned and walked back down the street.\nOn the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-\nOuter. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light\nsped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive\nglowed suddenly orange and he could make out a\ntabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end\nof the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets\non the step of number four.\n\n\u201cGood luck, Harry,\u201d he murmured. He turned on his\nheel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.\n\nA breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which\nlay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last\n\nPage | 18 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nplace you would expect astonishing things to happen.\nHarry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without\nwaking up. One small hand closed on the letter\nbeside him and he slept on, not knowing he was\nspecial, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he\nwould be woken in a few hours\u2019 time by Mrs.\n\nDursley\u2019s scream as she opened the front door to put\nout the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next\nfew weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin\nDudley. ... He couldn\u2019t know that at this very\nmoment, people meeting in secret all over the country\nwere holding up their glasses and saying in hushed\nvoices: \u201cTo Harry Potter \u2014 the boy who lived!\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 19 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE VANASHIG GLASS\n\nNearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had\nwoken up to find their nephew on the front step, but\nPrivet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose\non the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass\nnumber four on the Dursleys\u2019 front door; it crept into\ntheir living room, which was almost exactly the same\nas it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had\nseen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the\nphotographs on the mantelpiece really showed how\nmuch time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been\nlots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach\nball wearing different-colored bonnets \u2014 but Dudley\nDursley was no longer a baby, and now the\nphotographs showed a large blond boy riding his first\nbicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer\ngame with his father, being hugged and kissed by his\nmother. The room held no sign at all that another boy\nlived in the house, too.\n\nYet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment,\nbut not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it\n\n\n\nPage | 20 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nwas her shrill voice that made the first noise of the\nday.\n\n\u201cUp! Get up! Now!\u201d\n\nHarry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door\nagain.\n\n\u201cUp!\u201d she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward\nthe kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan\nbeing put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and\ntried to remember the dream he had been having. It\nhad been a good one. There had been a flying\nmotorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he\u2019d had the\nsame dream before.\n\nHis aunt was back outside the door.\n\n\u201cAre you up yet?\u201d she demanded.\n\n\u201cNearly,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, get a move on, I want you to look after the\nbacon. And don\u2019t you dare let it burn, I want\neverything perfect on Duddy\u2019s birthday.\u201d\n\nHarry groaned.\n\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d his aunt snapped through the\ndoor.\n\n\u201cNothing, nothing ...\u201d\n\nDudley\u2019s birthday \u2014 how could he have forgotten?\nHarry got slowly out of bed and started looking for\nsocks. He found a pair under his bed and, after\npulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry\nwas used to spiders, because the cupboard under the\nstairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.\nPage | 21 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nWhen he was dressed he went down the hall into the\nkitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all\nDudley\u2019s birthday presents. It looked as though\nDudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not\nto mention the second television and the racing bike.\nExactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a\nmystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated\nexercise \u2014 unless of course it involved punching\nsomebody. Dudley\u2019s favorite punching bag was Harry,\nbut he couldn\u2019t often catch him. Harry didn\u2019t look it,\nbut he was very fast.\n\nPerhaps it had something to do with living in a dark\ncupboard, but Harry had always been small and\nskinny for his age. He looked even smaller and\nskinnier than he really was because all he had to\nwear were old clothes of Dudley\u2019s, and Dudley was\nabout four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin\nface, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green\neyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot\nof Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had\npunched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked\nabout his own appearance was a very thin scar on his\nforehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He\nhad had it as long as he could remember, and the\nfirst question he could ever remember asking his\nAunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.\n\n\u201cIn the car crash when your parents died,\u201d she had\nsaid. \u201cAnd don\u2019t ask questions.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t ask questions \u2014 that was the first rule for a\nquiet life with the Dursleys.\n\nUncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was\nturning over the bacon.\n\n\u201cComb your hair!\u201d he barked, by way of a morning\ngreeting.\n\nPage | 22 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nAbout once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top\nof his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a\nhaircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the\nrest of the boys in his class put together, but it made\nno difference, his hair simply grew that way \u2014 all over\nthe place.\n\nHarry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in\nthe kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like\nUncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much\nneck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair\nthat lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia\noften said that Dudley looked like a baby angel \u2014\nHarry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a\nwig.\n\nHarry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table,\nwhich was difficult as there wasn\u2019t much room.\nDudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His\nface fell.\n\n\u201cThirty-six,\u201d he said, looking up at his mother and\nfather. \u201cThat\u2019s two less than last year.\u201d\n\n\u201cDarling, you haven\u2019t counted Auntie Marge\u2019s present,\nsee, it\u2019s here under this big one from Mommy and\nDaddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, thirty-seven then,\u201d said Dudley, going red\nin the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley\ntantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as\nfast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.\n\nAunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because\nshe said quickly, \u201cAnd we\u2019ll buy you another two\npresents while we\u2019re out today. How\u2019s that, popkin?\nTwo more presents. Is that all right?\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 23 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nDudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard\nwork. Finally he said slowly, \u201cSo I\u2019ll have thirty ...\nthirty ...\u201d\n\n\u201cThirty-nine, sweetums,\u201d said Aunt Petunia.\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the\nnearest parcel. \u201cAll right then.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon chuckled.\n\n\u201cLittle tyke wants his money\u2019s worth, just like his\nfather. \u2019Atta boy, Dudley!\u201d He ruffled Dudley\u2019s hair.\n\nAt that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia\nwent to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon\nwatched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video\ncamera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new\ncomputer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the\npaper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came\nback from the telephone looking both angry and\nworried.\n\n\u201cBad news, Vernon,\u201d she said. \u201cMrs. Figg\u2019s broken her\nleg. She can\u2019t take him.\u201d She jerked her head in\nHarry\u2019s direction.\n\nDudley\u2019s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry\u2019s heart\ngave a leap. Every year on Dudley\u2019s birthday, his\nparents took him and a friend out for the day, to\nadventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the\nmovies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs.\nFigg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away.\n\nHarry hated it there. The whole house smelled of\ncabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs\nof all the cats she\u2019d ever owned.\n\n\u201cNow what?\u201d said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at\nHarry as though he\u2019d planned this. Harry knew he\n\nPage | 24 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg,\nbut it wasn\u2019t easy when he reminded himself it would\nbe a whole year before he had to look at Tibbies,\nSnowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.\n\n\u201cWe could phone Marge,\u201d Uncle Vernon suggested.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\u201d\n\nThe Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as\nthough he wasn\u2019t there \u2014 or rather, as though he was\nsomething very nasty that couldn\u2019t understand them,\nlike a slug.\n\n\u201cWhat about what\u2019s-her-name, your friend \u2014\nYvonne?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn vacation in Majorca,\u201d snapped Aunt Petunia.\n\n\u201cYou could just leave me here,\u201d Harry put in hopefully\n(he\u2019d be able to watch what he wanted on television\nfor a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley\u2019s\ncomputer) .\n\nAunt Petunia looked as though she\u2019d just swallowed a\nlemon.\n\n\u201cAnd come back and find the house in ruins?\u201d she\nsnarled.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t blow up the house,\u201d said Harry, but they\nweren\u2019t listening.\n\n\u201cI suppose we could take him to the zoo,\u201d said Aunt\nPetunia slowly, "... and leave him in the car. ...\u201d\n\n\u201cThat cars new, he\u2019s not sitting in it alone. ...\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 25 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nDudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn\u2019t really\ncrying \u2014 it had been years since he\u2019d really cried \u2014\nbut he knew that if he screwed up his face and\nwailed, his mother would give him anything he\nwanted.\n\n\u201cDinky Duddydums, don\u2019t cry, Mummy won\u2019t let him\nspoil your special day!\u201d she cried, flinging her arms\naround him.\n\n\u201cI ... don\u2019t ... want ... him ... t-t-to come!\u201d Dudley\nyelled between huge, pretend sobs. \u201cHe always sp-\nspoils everything!\u201d He shot Harry a nasty grin through\nthe gap in his mothers arms.\n\nJust then, the doorbell rang \u2014 \u201cOh, good Lord,\nthey\u2019re here!\u201d said Aunt Petunia frantically \u2014 and a\nmoment later, Dudley\u2019s best friend, Piers Polkiss,\nwalked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy\nwith a face like a rat. He was usually the one who\nheld people\u2019s arms behind their backs while Dudley\nhit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.\n\nHalf an hour later, Harry, who couldn\u2019t believe his\nluck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys\u2019 car with\nPiers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first\ntime in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn\u2019t been able\nto think of anything else to do with him, but before\nthey\u2019d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m warning you,\u201d he had said, putting his large\npurple face right up close to Harry\u2019s, \u201cI\u2019m warning you\nnow, boy \u2014 any funny business, anything at all \u2014\nand you\u2019ll be in that cupboard from now until\nChristmas.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not going to do anything,\u201d said Harry, \u201chonestly\n\n\n\nPage | 26 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nBut Uncle Vernon didn\u2019t believe him. No one ever did.\n\n\n\nThe problem was, strange things often happened\naround Harry and it was just no good telling the\nDursleys he didn\u2019t make them happen.\n\nOnce, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from\nthe barbers looking as though he hadn\u2019t been at all,\nhad taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair\nso short he was almost bald except for his bangs,\nwhich she left \u201cto hide that horrible scar.\u201d Dudley had\nlaughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless\nnight imagining school the next day, where he was\nalready laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped\nglasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to\nfind his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt\nPetunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week\nin his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to\nexplain that he couldn\u2019t explain how it had grown\nback so quickly.\n\nAnother time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force\nhim into a revolting old sweater of Dudley\u2019s (brown\nwith orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it\nover his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until\nfinally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but\ncertainly wouldn\u2019t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided\nit must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great\nrelief, Harry wasn\u2019t punished.\n\nOn the other hand, he\u2019d gotten into terrible trouble\nfor being found on the roof of the school kitchens.\nDudley\u2019s gang had been chasing him as usual when,\nas much to Harry\u2019s surprise as anyone else\u2019s, there he\nwas sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had\nreceived a very angry letter from Harry\u2019s headmistress\ntelling them Harry had been climbing school\nbuildings. But all he\u2019d tried to do (as he shouted at\nUncle Vernon through the locked door of his\nPage | 27 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\ncupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans\noutside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the\nwind must have caught him in mid-jump.\n\nBut today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even\nworth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the\nday somewhere that wasn\u2019t school, his cupboard, or\nMrs. Figg\u2019s cabbage-smelling living room.\n\nWhile he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt\nPetunia. He liked to complain about things: people at\nwork, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry\nwere just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning,\nit was motorcycles.\n\n"... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\u201d\nhe said, as a motorcycle overtook them.\n\n\u201cI had a dream about a motorcycle,\u201d said Harry,\nremembering suddenly. \u201cIt was flying.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He\nturned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry,\nhis face like a gigantic beet with a mustache:\n\u201cMOTORCYCLES DONT FLY!\u201d\n\nDudley and Piers sniggered.\n\n\u201cI know they don\u2019t,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt was only a dream.\u201d\n\nBut he wished he hadn\u2019t said anything. If there was\none thing the Dursleys hated even more than his\nasking questions, it was his talking about anything\nacting in a way it shouldn\u2019t, no matter if it was in a\ndream or even a cartoon \u2014 they seemed to think he\nmight get dangerous ideas.\n\nIt was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was\ncrowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley\n\nPage | 28 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nand Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance\nand then, because the smiling lady in the van had\nasked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry\nhim away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It\nwasn\u2019t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they\nwatched a gorilla scratching its head who looked\nremarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn\u2019t blond.\n\nHarry had the best morning he\u2019d had in a long time.\nHe was careful to walk a little way apart from the\nDursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting\nto get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn\u2019t\nfall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They\nate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a\ntantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn\u2019t have\nenough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him\nanother one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.\n\nHarry felt, afterward, that he should have known it\nwas all too good to last.\n\nAfter lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool\nand dark in there, with lit windows all along the\nwalls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes\nwere crawling and slithering over bits of wood and\nstone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge,\npoisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons.\nDudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It\ncould have wrapped its body twice around Uncle\nVernon\u2019s car and crushed it into a trash can \u2014 but at\nthe moment it didn\u2019t look in the mood. In fact, it was\nfast asleep.\n\nDudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass,\nstaring at the glistening brown coils.\n\n\u201cMake it move,\u201d he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon\ntapped on the glass, but the snake didn\u2019t budge.\n\n\n\nPage | 29 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDo it again,\u201d Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped\nthe glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake\njust snoozed on.\n\n\u201cThis is boring,\u201d Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.\n\nHarry moved in front of the tank and looked intently\nat the snake. He wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if it\nhad died of boredom itself \u2014 no company except\nstupid people drumming their fingers on the glass\ntrying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than\nhaving a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only\nvisitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to\nwake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the\nhouse.\n\nThe snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly,\nvery slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a\nlevel with Harry\u2019s.\n\nIt winked.\n\nHarry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if\nanyone was watching. They weren\u2019t. He looked back\nat the snake and winked, too.\n\nThe snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and\nDudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave\nHarry a look that said quite plainly:\n\n\u201cI get that all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Harry murmured through the glass, though\nhe wasn\u2019t sure the snake could hear him. \u201cIt must be\nreally annoying.\u201d\n\nThe snake nodded vigorously.\n\n\u201cWhere do you come from, anyway?\u201d Harry asked.\n\nPage | 30 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nThe snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the\nglass. Harry peered at it.\n\nBoa Constrictor, Brazil.\n\n\u201cWas it nice there?\u201d\n\nThe boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again\nand Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the\nzoo. \u201cOh, I see \u2014 so you\u2019ve never been to Brazil?\u201d\n\nAs the snake shook its head, a deafening shout\nbehind Harry made both of them jump. \u201cDUDLEY!\nMR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE!\nYOU WONT BELIEVE WHAT IT\u2019S DOING!\u201d\n\nDudley came waddling toward them as fast as he\ncould.\n\n\u201cOut of the way, you,\u201d he said, punching Harry in the\nribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the\nconcrete floor. What came next happened so fast no\none saw how it happened \u2014 one second, Piers and\nDudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the\nnext, they had leapt back with howls of horror.\n\nHarry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa\nconstrictor\u2019s tank had vanished. The great snake was\nuncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor.\nPeople throughout the reptile house screamed and\nstarted running for the exits.\n\nAs the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have\nsworn a low, hissing voice said, \u201cBrazil, here I come.\n... Thanksss, amigo.\u201d\n\nThe keeper of the reptile house was in shock.\n\n\n\nPage | 31 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBut the glass,\u201d he kept saying, \u201cwhere did the glass\ngo?\u201d "\n\nThe zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of\nstrong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over\nagain. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as\nHarry had seen, the snake hadn\u2019t done anything\nexcept snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but\nby the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon\u2019s car,\nDudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off\nhis leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to\nsqueeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at\nleast, was Piers calming down enough to say, \u201cHarry\nwas talking to it, weren\u2019t you, Harry?\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the\nhouse before starting on Harry. He was so angry he\ncould hardly speak. He managed to say, \u201cGo \u2014\ncupboard \u2014 stay \u2014 no meals,\u201d before he collapsed\ninto a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get\nhim a large brandy.\n\nHarry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing\nhe had a watch. He didn\u2019t know what time it was and\nhe couldn\u2019t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet.\n\nUntil they were, he couldn\u2019t risk sneaking to the\nkitchen for some food.\n\nHe\u2019d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten\nmiserable years, as long as he could remember, ever\nsince he\u2019d been a baby and his parents had died in\nthat car crash. He couldn\u2019t remember being in the car\nwhen his parents had died. Sometimes, when he\nstrained his memory during long hours in his\ncupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a\nblinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his\nforehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though\nhe couldn\u2019t imagine where all the green light came\nfrom. He couldn\u2019t remember his parents at all. His\nPage | 32 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\naunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of\ncourse he was forbidden to ask questions. There were\nno photographs of them in the house.\n\nWhen he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and\ndreamed of some unknown relation coming to take\nhim away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys\nwere his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or\nmaybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to\nknow him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A\ntiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once\nwhile out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley.\nAfter asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt\nPetunia had rushed them out of the shop without\nbuying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed\nall in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus.\n\nA bald man in a very long purple coat had actually\nshaken his hand in the street the other day and then\nwalked away without a word. The weirdest thing\nabout all these people was the way they seemed to\nvanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look.\n\nAt school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that\nDudley\u2019s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his\nbaggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody\nliked to disagree with Dudley\u2019s gang.\n\n\n\nPage | 33 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\nTHE LETTERS FROM NO ONE\n\nThe escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned\nHarry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he\nwas allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer\nholidays had started and Dudley had already broken\nhis new video camera, crashed his remote control\nairplane, and, first time out on his racing bike,\nknocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet\nDrive on her crutches.\n\nHarry was glad school was over, but there was no\nescaping Dudley\u2019s gang, who visited the house every\nsingle day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were\nall big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and\nstupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of\nthem were all quite happy to join in Dudley\u2019s favorite\nsport: Harry Hunting.\n\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible\nout of the house, wandering around and thinking\nabout the end of the holidays, where he could see a\ntiny ray of hope. When September came he would be\ngoing off to secondary school and, for the first time in\nPage | 34 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\nhis life, he wouldn\u2019t be with Dudley. Dudley had been\naccepted at Uncle Vernon\u2019s old private school,\nSmeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry,\non the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the\nlocal public school. Dudley thought this was very\nfunny.\n\n\u201cThey stuff people\u2019s heads down the toilet the first day\nat Stonewall,\u201d he told Harry. \u201cWant to come upstairs\nand practice?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThe poor toilet\u2019s never had\nanything as horrible as your head down it \u2014 it might\nbe sick.\u201d Then he ran, before Dudley could work out\nwhat he\u2019d said.\n\nOne day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London\nto buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs.\nFigg\u2019s. Mrs. Figg wasn\u2019t as bad as usual. It turned out\nshe\u2019d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and\nshe didn\u2019t seem quite as fond of them as before. She\nlet Harry watch television and gave him a bit of\nchocolate cake that tasted as though she\u2019d had it for\nseveral years.\n\nThat evening, Dudley paraded around the living room\nfor the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings\nboys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers,\nand flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried\nknobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the\nteachers weren\u2019t looking. This was supposed to be\ngood training for later life.\n\nAs he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers,\nUncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest\nmoment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and\nsaid she couldn\u2019t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins,\nhe looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn\u2019t\n\n\n\nPage | 35 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\ntrust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs\nmight already have cracked from trying not to laugh.\n\n\n\nk k k\n\n\n\nThere was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next\nmorning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed\nto be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He\nwent to have a look. The tub was full of what looked\nlike dirty rags swimming in gray water.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips\ntightened as they always did if he dared to ask a\nquestion.\n\n\u201cYour new school uniform,\u201d she said.\n\nHarry looked in the bowl again.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it had to be so wet.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d snapped Aunt Petunia. \u201cI\u2019m dyeing\nsome of Dudley\u2019s old things gray for you. It\u2019ll look just\nlike everyone else\u2019s when I\u2019ve finished.\u201d\n\nHarry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not\nto argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to\nthink about how he was going to look on his first day\nat Stonewall High \u2014 like he was wearing bits of old\nelephant skin, probably.\n\nDudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with\nwrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry\u2019s new\nuniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as\nusual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which\nhe carried everywhere, on the table.\n\nThey heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters\non the doormat.\n\nPage | 36 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGet the mail, Dudley,\u201d said Uncle Vernon from\nbehind his paper.\n\n\u201cMake Harry get it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet the mail, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake Dudley get it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.\u201d\n\nHarry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the\nmail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard\nfrom Uncle Vernon\u2019s sister Marge, who was\nvacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope\nthat looked like a bill, and \u2014 a letter for Harry.\n\nHarry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging\nlike a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole\nlife, had written to him. Who would? He had no\nfriends, no other relatives \u2014 he didn\u2019t belong to the\nlibrary, so he\u2019d never even got rude notes asking for\nbooks back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so\nplainly there could be no mistake:\n\nMr. H. Potter\n\nThe Cupboard under the Stairs\n4 Privet Drive\nLittle Whinging\nSurrey\n\nThe envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish\nparchment, and the address was written in emerald-\ngreen ink. There was no stamp.\n\n\n\nPage | 37 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nTurning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry\nsaw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion,\nan eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large\nletter H.\n\n\u201cHurry up, boy!\u201d shouted Uncle Vernon from the\nkitchen. \u201cWhat are you doing, checking for letter\nbombs?\u201d He chuckled at his own joke.\n\nHarry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his\nletter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the\npostcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the\nyellow envelope.\n\nUncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust,\nand flipped over the postcard.\n\n\u201cMarge\u2019s ill,\u201d he informed Aunt Petunia. \u201cAte a funny\nwhelk ...\u201d\n\n\u201cDad!\u201d said Dudley suddenly. \u201cDad, Harry\u2019s got\nsomething!\u201d\n\nHarry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which\nwas written on the same heavy parchment as the\nenvelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand\nby Uncle Vernon.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s mine\u201d said Harry, trying to snatch it back.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019d be writing to you?\u201d sneered Uncle Vernon,\nshaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at\nit. His face went from red to green faster than a set of\ntraffic lights. And it didn\u2019t stop there. Within seconds\nit was the grayish white of old porridge.\n\n\u201cP-P-Petunia!\u201d he gasped.\n\n\n\nPage | 38 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nDudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle\nVernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia\ntook it curiously and read the first line. For a moment\nit looked as though she might faint. She clutched her\nthroat and made a choking noise.\n\n\u201cVernon! Oh my goodness \u2014 Vernon!\u201d\n\nThey stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten\nthat Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley\nwasn\u2019t used to being ignored. He gave his father a\nsharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.\n\n\u201cI want to read that letter,\u201d he said loudly.\n\n\u201cI want to read it,\u201d said Harry furiously, \u201cas it\u2019s mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet out, both of you,\u201d croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing\nthe letter back inside its envelope.\n\nHarry didn\u2019t move.\n\n\u201cI WANT MY LETTER!\u201d he shouted.\n\n\u201cLet me see it!\u201d demanded Dudley.\n\n\u201cOUT!\u201d roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry\nand Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw\nthem into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind\nthem. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but\nsilent fight over who would listen at the keyhole;\nDudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one\near, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack\nbetween door and floor.\n\n\u201cVernon,\u201d Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering\nvoice, \u201clook at the address \u2014 how could they possibly\nknow where he sleeps? You don\u2019t think they\u2019re\nwatching the house?\u201d\n\nPage | 39 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWatching \u2014 spying \u2014 might be following us,\u201d\nmuttered Uncle Vernon wildly.\n\n\u201cBut what should we do, Vernon? Should we write\nback? Tell them we don\u2019t want \u2014 \u201d\n\nHarry could see Uncle Vernon\u2019s shiny black shoes\npacing up and down the kitchen.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said finally. \u201cNo, we\u2019ll ignore it. If they don\u2019t\nget an answer. ... Yes, that\u2019s best ... we won\u2019t do\nanything. ...\u201d\n\n\u201cBut \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn\u2019t we\nswear when we took him in we\u2019d stamp out that\ndangerous nonsense?\u201d\n\nThat evening when he got back from work, Uncle\nVernon did something he\u2019d never done before; he\nvisited Harry in his cupboard.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my letter?\u201d said Harry, the moment Uncle\nVernon had squeezed through the door. \u201cWho\u2019s\nwriting to me?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one. It was addressed to you by mistake,\u201d said\nUncle Vernon shortly. \u201cI have burned it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was not a mistake,\u201d said Harry angrily, \u201cit had my\ncupboard on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSILENCE!\u201d yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of\nspiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep\nbreaths and then forced his face into a smile, which\nlooked quite painful.\n\n\n\nPage | 40 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 yes, Harry \u2014 about this cupboard. Your aunt\nand I have been thinking ... you\u2019re really getting a bit\nbig for it . . . we think it might be nice if you moved\ninto Dudley\u2019s second bedroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask questions!\u201d snapped his uncle. \u201cTake this\nstuff upstairs, now.\u201d\n\nThe Dursleys\u2019 house had four bedrooms: one for\nUncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors\n(usually Uncle Vernon\u2019s sister, Marge), one where\nDudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys\nand things that wouldn\u2019t fit into his first bedroom. It\nonly took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything\nhe owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat\ndown on the bed and stared around him. Nearly\neverything in here was broken. The month-old video\ncamera was lying on top of a small, working tank\nDudley had once driven over the next door neighbor\u2019s\ndog; in the corner was Dudley\u2019s first-ever television\nset, which he\u2019d put his foot through when his favorite\nprogram had been canceled; there was a large\nbirdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley\nhad swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was\nup on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley\nhad sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They\nwere the only things in the room that looked as\nthough they\u2019d never been touched.\n\nFrom downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling\nat his mother, \u201cI don\u2019t want him in there ... I need\nthat room ... make him get out. ...\u201d\n\nHarry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday\nhe\u2019d have given anything to be up here. Today he\u2019d\nrather be back in his cupboard with that letter than\nup here without it.\n\nPage | 41 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nNext morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet.\nDudley was in shock. He\u2019d screamed, whacked his\nfather with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose,\nkicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through\nthe greenhouse roof, and he still didn\u2019t have his room\nback. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday\nand bitterly wishing he\u2019d opened the letter in the hall.\nUncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each\nother darkly.\n\nWhen the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to\nbe trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get\nit. They heard him banging things with his Smelting\nstick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted,\n\u201cThere\u2019s another one! \u2018Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest\nBedroom, 4 Privet Drive \u2014 \u2019 \u201d\n\nWith a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his\nseat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him.\nUncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to\nget the letter from him, which was made difficult by\nthe fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around\nthe neck from behind. After a minute of confused\nfighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the\nSmelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up,\ngasping for breath, with Harry\u2019s letter clutched in his\nhand.\n\n\u201cGo to your cupboard \u2014 I mean, your bedroom,\u201d he\nwheezed at Harry. \u201cDudley \u2014 go \u2014 just go.\u201d\n\nHarry walked round and round his new room.\nSomeone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and\nthey seemed to know he hadn\u2019t received his first\nletter. Surely that meant they\u2019d try again? And this\ntime he\u2019d make sure they didn\u2019t fail. He had a plan.\n\nThe repaired alarm clock rang at six o\u2019clock the next\nmorning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed\n\nPage | 42 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nsilently. He mustn\u2019t wake the Dursleys. He stole\ndownstairs without turning on any of the lights.\n\nHe was going to wait for the postman on the corner of\nPrivet Drive and get the letters for number four first.\nHis heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall\ntoward the front door \u2014\n\n\u201cAAAAARRRGH ! \u201d\n\nHarry leapt into the air; he\u2019d trodden on something\nbig and squashy on the doormat \u2014 something alive\nLights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry\nrealized that the big, squashy something had been his\nuncle\u2019s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot\nof the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making\nsure that Harry didn\u2019t do exactly what he\u2019d been\ntrying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an\nhour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea.\nHarry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by\nthe time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into\nUncle Vernon\u2019s lap. Harry could see three letters\naddressed in green ink.\n\n\u201cI want \u2014 \u201d he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing\nthe letters into pieces before his eyes.\n\nUncle Vernon didn\u2019t go to work that day. He stayed at\nhome and nailed up the mail slot.\n\n\u201cSee,\u201d he explained to Aunt Petunia through a\nmouthful of nails, \u201cif they can\u2019t deliver them they\u2019ll\njust give up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019ll work, Vernon.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, these peoples minds work in strange ways,\nPetunia, they\u2019re not like you and me,\u201d said Uncle\n\nPage | 43 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nVernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of\nfruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.\n\nOn Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for\nHarry. As they couldn\u2019t go through the mail slot they\nhad been pushed under the door, slotted through the\nsides, and a few even forced through the small\nwindow in the downstairs bathroom.\n\nUncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all\nthe letters, he got out a hammer and nails and\nboarded up the cracks around the front and back\ndoors so no one could go out. He hummed \u201cTiptoe\nThrough the Tulips\u201d as he worked, and jumped at\nsmall noises.\n\nOn Saturday, things began to get out of hand.\nTwenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the\nhouse, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two\ndozen eggs that their very confused milkman had\nhanded Aunt Petunia through the living room\nwindow. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone\ncalls to the post office and the dairy trying to find\nsomeone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the\nletters in her food processor.\n\n\u201cWho on earth wants to talk to you this badly?\u201d\nDudley asked Harry in amazement.\n\n\n\n\u2022k k k\n\n\n\nOn Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the\nbreakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.\n\n\u201cNo post on Sundays,\u201d he reminded them cheerfully\nas he spread marmalade on his newspapers, \u201cno\ndamn letters today \u2014 \u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 44 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nSomething came whizzing down the kitchen chimney\nas he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of\nthe head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came\npelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys\nducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch\none \u2014\n\n\u201cOut! OUT!\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and\nthrew him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and\nDudley had run out with their arms over their faces,\nUncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could\nhear the letters still streaming into the room,\nbouncing off the walls and floor.\n\n\u201cThat does it,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak\ncalmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at\nthe same time. \u201cI want you all back here in five\nminutes ready to leave. We\u2019re going away. Just pack\nsome clothes. No arguments!\u201d\n\nHe looked so dangerous with half his mustache\nmissing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later\nthey had wrenched their way through the boarded-up\ndoors and were in the car, speeding toward the\nhighway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his\nfather had hit him round the head for holding them\nup while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and\ncomputer in his sports bag.\n\nThey drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn\u2019t\ndare ask where they were going. Every now and then\nUncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in\nthe opposite direction for a while.\n\n\u201cShake \u2019em off ... shake \u2019em off,\u201d he would mutter\nwhenever he did this.\n\n\n\nPage | 45 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nThey didn\u2019t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall\nDudley was howling. He\u2019d never had such a bad day\nin his life. He was hungry, he\u2019d missed five television\nprograms he\u2019d wanted to see, and he\u2019d never gone so\nlong without blowing up an alien on his computer.\n\nUncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-\nlooking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley\nand Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp,\nmusty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake,\nsitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of\npassing cars and wondering...\n\nThey ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on\ntoast for breakfast the next day. They had just\nfinished when the owner of the hotel came over to\ntheir table.\n\n\u201c \u2019Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I\ngot about an \u2019undred of these at the front desk.\u201d\n\nShe held up a letter so they could read the green ink\naddress:\n\nMr. H. Potter\n\nRoom 1 7\n\nRailview Hotel\n\nCokeworth\n\nHarry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon\nknocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take them,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, standing up\nquickly and following her from the dining room.\n\n\u2022k k k\n\nPage | 46 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better just to go home, dear?\u201d Aunt\nPetunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle\nVernon didn\u2019t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was\nlooking for, none of them knew. He drove them into\nthe middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook\nhis head, got back in the car, and off they went again.\nThe same thing happened in the middle of a plowed\nfield, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the\ntop of a multilevel parking garage.\n\n\u201cDaddy\u2019s gone mad, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d Dudley asked Aunt\nPetunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had\nparked at the coast, locked them all inside the car,\nand disappeared.\n\nIt started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the\ncar. Dudley sniveled.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Monday,\u201d he told his mother. \u201cThe Great\nHumberto\u2019s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with\na television.\u201d\n\nMonday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was\nMonday \u2014 and you could usually count on Dudley to\nknow the days of the week, because of television \u2014\nthen tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry\u2019s eleventh\nbirthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly\nfun \u2014 last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat\nhanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon\u2019s old socks. Still,\nyou weren\u2019t eleven every day.\n\nUncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was\nalso carrying a long, thin package and didn\u2019t answer\nAunt Petunia when she asked what he\u2019d bought.\n\n\u201cFound the perfect place!\u201d he said. \u201cCome on!\n\nEveryone out!\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 47 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nIt was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was\npointing at what looked like a large rock way out at\nsea. Perched on top of the rock was the most\nmiserable little shack you could imagine. One thing\nwas certain, there was no television in there.\n\n\u201cStorm forecast for tonight!\u201d said Uncle Vernon\ngleefully, clapping his hands together. \u201cAnd this\ngentleman\u2019s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!\u201d\n\nA toothless old man came ambling up to them,\npointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat\nbobbing in the iron-gray water below them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already got us some rations,\u201d said Uncle Vernon,\n\u201cso all aboard!\u201d\n\nIt was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain\ncrept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped\ntheir faces. After what seemed like hours they\nreached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and\nsliding, led the way to the broken-down house.\n\nThe inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of\nseaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the\nwooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty.\nThere were only two rooms.\n\nUncle Vernon\u2019s rations turned out to be a bag of chips\neach and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the\nempty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.\n\n\u201cCould do with some of those letters now, eh?\u201d he said\ncheerfully.\n\nHe was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought\nnobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a\nstorm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though\nthe thought didn\u2019t cheer him up at all.\n\nPage | 48 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nAs night fell, the promised storm blew up around\nthem. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls\nof the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy\nwindows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in\nthe second room and made up a bed for Dudley on\nthe moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off\nto the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find\nthe softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under\nthe thinnest, most ragged blanket.\n\nThe storm raged more and more ferociously as the\nnight went on. Harry couldn\u2019t sleep. He shivered and\nturned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach\nrumbling with hunger. Dudley\u2019s snores were drowned\nby the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight.\nThe lighted dial of Dudley\u2019s watch, which was\ndangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told\nHarry he\u2019d be eleven in ten minutes\u2019 time. He lay and\nwatched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the\nDursleys would remember at all, wondering where the\nletter writer was now.\n\nFive minutes to go. Harry heard something creak\noutside. He hoped the roof wasn\u2019t going to fall in,\nalthough he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes\nto go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so\nfull of letters when they got back that he\u2019d be able to\nsteal one somehow.\n\nThree minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard\non the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what\nwas that funny crunching noise? Was the rock\ncrumbling into the sea?\n\nOne minute to go and he\u2019d be eleven. Thirty seconds\n... twenty ... ten ... nine \u2014 maybe he\u2019d wake Dudley\nup, just to annoy him \u2014 three ... two ... one ...\n\nBOOM.\n\nPage | 49 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nThe whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright,\nstaring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking\nto come in.\n\n\n\nPage | 50 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE KEEPER OF THE KEYS\n\nBOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the cannon?\u201d he said stupidly.\n\nThere was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon\ncame skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in\nhis hands \u2014 now they knew what had been in the\nlong, thin package he had brought with them.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he shouted. \u201cI warn you \u2014 I\u2019m armed!\u201d\n\nThere was a pause. Then \u2014\n\nSMASH!\n\nThe door was hit with such force that it swung clean\noff its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat\non the floor.\n\nA giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His\nface was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy\nmane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could\n\nPage | 51 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\nmake out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under\nall the hair.\n\nThe giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so\nthat his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down,\npicked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its\nframe. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little.\nHe turned to look at them all.\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t make us a cup o\u2019 tea, could yeh? It\u2019s not\nbeen an easy journey. ...\u201d\n\nHe strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen\nwith fear.\n\n\u201cBudge up, yeh great lump,\u201d said the stranger.\n\nDudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother,\nwho was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.\n\n\u201cAn\u2019 here\u2019s Harry!\u201d said the giant.\n\nHarry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face\nand saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.\n\n\u201cLas\u2019 time I saw you, you was only a baby,\u201d said the\ngiant. \u201cYeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh\u2019ve got yer\nmom\u2019s eyes.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.\n\n\u201cI demand that you leave at once, sir!\u201d he said. \u201cYou\nare breaking and entering!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\u201d said the\ngiant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the\ngun out of Uncle Vernon\u2019s hands, bent it into a knot\nas easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw\nit into a corner of the room.\n\nPage | 52 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nUncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a\nmouse being trodden on.\n\n\u201cAnyway \u2014 Harry,\u201d said the giant, turning his back\non the Dursleys, \u201ca very happy birthday to yeh. Got\nsummat fer yeh here \u2014 I mighta sat on it at some\npoint, but it\u2019ll taste all right.\u201d\n\nFrom an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled\na slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with\ntrembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate\ncake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green\nicing.\n\nHarry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank\nyou, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth,\nand what he said instead was, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\nThe giant chuckled.\n\n\u201cTrue, I haven\u2019t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid,\nKeeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\nHe held out an enormous hand and shook Harry\u2019s\nwhole arm.\n\n\u201cWhat about that tea then, eh?\u201d he said, rubbing his\nhands together. \u201cI\u2019d not say no ter summat stronger if\nyeh\u2019ve got it, mind.\u201d\n\nHis eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled\nchip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the\nfireplace; they couldn\u2019t see what he was doing but\nwhen he drew back a second later, there was a\nroaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with\nflickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over\nhim as though he\u2019d sunk into a hot bath.\n\n\n\nPage | 53 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nThe giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged\nunder his weight, and began taking all sorts of things\nout of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a\nsquashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot,\nseveral chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber\nliquid that he took a swig from before starting to\nmake tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and\nsmell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while\nthe giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat,\njuicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley\nfidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, \u201cDon\u2019t\ntouch anything he gives you, Dudley.\u201d\n\nThe giant chuckled darkly.\n\n\u201cYer great puddin\u2019 of a son don\u2019 need fattenin\u2019\nanymore, Dursley, don\u2019 worry.\u201d\n\nHe passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry\nhe had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he\nstill couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as\nnobody seemed about to explain anything, he said,\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I still don\u2019t really know who you are.\u201d\n\nThe giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with\nthe back of his hand.\n\n\u201cCall me Hagrid,\u201d he said, \u201ceveryone does. An\u2019 like I\ntold yeh, I\u2019m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts \u2014 yeh\u2019ll\nknow all about Hogwarts, o\u2019 course.\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 no,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHagrid looked shocked.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Harry said quickly.\n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the\nDursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. \u201cIt\u2019s\n\nPage | 54 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nthem as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren\u2019t gettin\u2019\nyer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn\u2019t even\nknow abou\u2019 Hogwarts, fer cryin\u2019 out loud! Did yeh\nnever wonder where yer parents learned it all?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll what?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cALL WHAT?\u201d Hagrid thundered. \u201cNow wait jus\u2019 one\nsecond!\u201d\n\nHe had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill\nthe whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against\nthe wall.\n\n\u201cDo you mean ter tell me,\u201d he growled at the Dursleys,\n\u201cthat this boy \u2014 this boy! \u2014 knows nothin\u2019 abou\u2019 \u2014\nabout ANYTHING?\u201d\n\nHarry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to\nschool, after all, and his marks weren\u2019t bad.\n\n\u201cI know some things,\u201d he said. \u201cI can, you know, do\nmath and stuff.\u201d\n\nBut Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, \u201cAbout\nour world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents\u2019\nworld.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat world?\u201d\n\nHagrid looked as if he was about to explode.\n\u201cDURSLEY!\u201d he boomed.\n\nUncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered\nsomething that sounded like \u201cMimblewimble.\u201d Hagrid\nstared wildly at Harry.\n\n\n\nPage | 55 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBut yeh must know about yer mom and dad,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cI mean, they\u2019re famous. You\u2019re famous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? My \u2014 my mom and dad weren\u2019t famous, were\nthey?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeh don\u2019 know ... yeh don\u2019 know ...\u201d Hagrid ran his\nfingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a\nbewildered stare.\n\n\u201cYeh don\u2019 know what yeh are?\u201d he said finally.\n\nUncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.\n\n\u201cStop!\u201d he commanded. \u201cStop right there, sir! I forbid\nyou to tell the boy anything!\u201d\n\nA braver man than Vernon Dursley would have\nquailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him;\nwhen Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with\nrage.\n\n\u201cYou never told him? Never told him what was in the\nletter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw\nDumbledore leave it, Dursley! An\u2019 you\u2019ve kept it from\nhim all these years?\u201d\n\n\u201cKept what from me?\u201d said Harry eagerly.\n\n\u201cSTOP! I FORBID YOU!\u201d yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.\n\nAunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.\n\n\u201cAh, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\u201cHarry \u2014 yer a wizard.\u201d\n\nThere was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and\nthe whistling wind could be heard.\n\n\n\nPage | 56 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a what?\u201d gasped Harry.\n\n\n\n\u201cA wizard, o\u2019 course,\u201d said Hagrid, sitting back down\non the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, \u201can\u2019\na thumpin\u2019 good\u2019un, I\u2019d say, once yeh\u2019ve been trained\nup a bit. With a mum an\u2019 dad like yours, what else\nwould yeh be? An\u2019 I reckon it\u2019s abou\u2019 time yeh read\nyer letter.\u201d\n\nHarry stretched out his hand at last to take the\nyellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr.\nH. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He\npulled out the letter and read:\n\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL\no/WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\n\nHeadmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\n\n(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sore., Chf.\n\nWarlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of\nWizards)\n\nDear Mr. Potter,\n\nWe are pleased to inform you that you have been\naccepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and\nWizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary\nbooks and equipment.\n\nTerm begins on September 1. We await your owl by no\nlater than July 31.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMinerva McGonagall,\n\nDeputy Headmistress\n\n\n\nPage | 57 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nQuestions exploded inside Harry\u2019s head like fireworks\nand he couldn\u2019t decide which to ask first. After a few\nminutes he stammered, \u201cWhat does it mean, they\nawait my owl?\u201d\n\n\u201cGallopin\u2019 Gorgons, that reminds me,\u201d said Hagrid,\nclapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to\nknock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket\ninside his overcoat he pulled an owl \u2014 a real, live,\nrather ruffled-looking owl \u2014 a long quill, and a roll of\nparchment. With his tongue between his teeth he\nscribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:\n\nDear Professor Dumbledore,\n\nGiven Harry his letter.\n\nTaking him to buy his things tomorrow.\n\nWeather\u2019s horrible. Hope you\u2019re well.\n\nHagrid\n\nHagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which\nclamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw\nthe owl out into the storm. Then he came back and\nsat down as though this was as normal as talking on\nthe telephone.\n\nHarry realized his mouth was open and closed it\nquickly.\n\n\u201cWhere was I?\u201d said Hagrid, but at that moment,\n\nUncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very\nangry, moved into the firelight.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going,\u201d he said.\n\nHagrid grunted.\n\nPage | 58 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\n\n\n\u201cA what?\u201d said Harry, interested.\n\n\u201cA Muggle,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cit\u2019s what we call nonmagic\nfolk like them. An\u2019 it\u2019s your bad luck you grew up in a\nfamily o\u2019 the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe swore when we took him in we\u2019d put a stop to\nthat rubbish,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, \u201cswore we\u2019d stamp\nit out of him! Wizard indeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou knew?\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou knew I\u2019m a \u2014 a\nwizard?\u201d\n\n\u201cKnew!\u201d shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. \u201cKnew Of\ncourse we knew! How could you not be, my dratted\nsister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just\nlike that and disappeared off to that \u2014 that school \u2014\nand came home every vacation with her pockets full\nof frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the\nonly one who saw her for what she was \u2014 a freak!\n\nBut for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this\nand Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in\nthe family!\u201d\n\nShe stopped to draw a deep breath and then went\nranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all\nthis for years.\n\n\u201cThen she met that Potter at school and they left and\ngot married and had you, and of course I knew you\u2019d\nbe just the same, just as strange, just as \u2014 as \u2014\nabnormal \u2014 and then, if you please, she went and got\nherself blown up and we got landed with you!\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 59 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nHarry had gone very white. As soon as he found his\nvoice he said, \u201cBlown up? You told me they died in a\ncar crash!\u201d\n\n\u201cCAR CRASH!\u201d roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily\nthat the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. \u201cHow\ncould a car crash kill Lily an\u2019 James Potter? It\u2019s an\noutrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin\u2019 his own\nstory when every kid in our world knows his name!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why? What happened?\u201d Harry asked urgently.\n\nThe anger faded from Hagrid\u2019s face. He looked\nsuddenly anxious.\n\n\u201cI never expected this,\u201d he said, in a low, worried\nvoice. \u201cI had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there\nmight be trouble gettin\u2019 hold of yeh, how much yeh\ndidn\u2019t know. Ah, Harry, I don\u2019 know if I\u2019m the right\nperson ter tell yeh \u2014 but someone\u2019s gotta \u2014 yeh can\u2019t\ngo off ter Hogwarts not knowin\u2019.\u201d\n\nHe threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh \u2014\nmind, I can\u2019t tell yeh everythin\u2019, it\u2019s a great myst\u2019ry,\nparts of it. ...\u201d\n\nHe sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds,\nand then said, \u201cIt begins, I suppose, with \u2014 with a\nperson called \u2014 but it\u2019s incredible yeh don\u2019t know his\nname, everyone in our world knows \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell \u2014 I don\u2019 like sayin\u2019 the name if I can help it. No\none does.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\nPage | 60 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGulpin\u2019 gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared.\nBlimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard\nwho went ... bad. As bad as you could go. Worse.\nWorse than worse. His name was ...\u201d\n\nHagrid gulped, but no words came out.\n\n\u201cCould you write it down?\u201d Harry suggested.\n\n\u201cNah \u2014 can\u2019t spell it. All right \u2014 Voldemort.\u201d Hagrid\nshuddered. \u201cDon\u2019 make me say it again. Anyway, this\n\u2014 this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started\nlookin\u2019 fer followers. Got \u2019em, too \u2014 some were afraid,\nsome just wanted a bit o\u2019 his power, \u2019cause he was\ngettin\u2019 himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry.\nDidn\u2019t know who ter trust, didn\u2019t dare get friendly\nwith strange wizards or witches . . . terrible things\nhappened. He was takin\u2019 over. \u2019Course, some stood up\nto him \u2014 an\u2019 he killed \u2019em. Horribly. One o\u2019 the only\nsafe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore\u2019s\nthe only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn\u2019t dare\ntry takin\u2019 the school, not jus\u2019 then, anyway.\n\n\u201cNow, yer mum an\u2019 dad were as good a witch an\u2019\nwizard as I ever knew. Head boy an\u2019 girl at Hogwarts\nin their day! Suppose the myst\u2019ry is why You-Know-\nWho never tried to get \u2019em on his side before . . .\nprobably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter\nwant anythin\u2019 ter do with the Dark Side.\n\n\u201cMaybe he thought he could persuade \u2019em ... maybe\nhe just wanted \u2019em outta the way. All anyone knows\nis, he turned up in the village where you was all\nliving, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a\nyear old. He came ter yer house an\u2019 \u2014 an\u2019 \u2014 \u201d\n\nHagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted\nhandkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a\nfoghorn.\n\nPage | 61 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s that sad \u2014 knew yer mum\nan\u2019 dad, an\u2019 nicer people yeh couldn\u2019t find \u2014 anyway\n\n\n\n\u201cYou-Know-Who killed \u2019em. An\u2019 then \u2014 an\u2019 this is the\nreal myst\u2019ry of the thing \u2014 he tried to kill you, too.\nWanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or\nmaybe he just liked killin\u2019 by then. But he couldn\u2019t do\nit. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer\nforehead? That was no ordinary cut. That\u2019s what yeh\nget when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh \u2014 took\ncare of yer mum an\u2019 dad an\u2019 yer house, even \u2014 but it\ndidn\u2019t work on you, an\u2019 that\u2019s why yer famous, Harry.\nNo one ever lived after he decided ter kill \u2019em, no one\nexcept you, an\u2019 he\u2019d killed some o\u2019 the best witches\nan\u2019 wizards of the age \u2014 the McKinnons, the Bones,\nthe Prewetts \u2014 an\u2019 you was only a baby, an\u2019 you\nlived.\u201d\n\nSomething very painful was going on in Harry\u2019s mind.\nAs Hagrid\u2019s story came to a close, he saw again the\nblinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had\never remembered it before \u2014 and he remembered\nsomething else, for the first time in his life: a high,\ncold, cruel laugh.\n\nHagrid was watching him sadly.\n\n\u201cTook yeh from the ruined house myself, on\nDumbledore\u2019s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot ...\u201d\n\n\u201cLoad of old tosh,\u201d said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped;\nhe had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there.\nUncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his\ncourage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were\nclenched.\n\n\u201cNow, you listen here, boy,\u201d he snarled, \u201cI accept\nthere\u2019s something strange about you, probably\n\nPage | 62 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nnothing a good beating wouldn\u2019t have cured \u2014 and as\nfor all this about your parents, well, they were\nweirdos, no denying it, and the world\u2019s better off\nwithout them in my opinion \u2014 asked for all they got,\ngetting mixed up with these wizarding types \u2014 just\nwhat I expected, always knew they\u2019d come to a sticky\nend \u2014 \u201d\n\nBut at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and\ndrew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat.\nPointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said,\n\u201cI\u2019m warning you, Dursley \u2014 I\u2019m warning you \u2014 one\nmore word ...\u201d\n\nIn danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella\nby a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon\u2019s courage failed\nagain; he flattened himself against the wall and fell\nsilent.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d said Hagrid, breathing heavily and\nsitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged\nright down to the floor.\n\nHarry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask,\nhundreds of them.\n\n\u201cBut what happened to Vol-, sorry \u2014 I mean, You-\nKnow-Who?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same\nnight he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more\nfamous. That\u2019s the biggest myst\u2019ry, see ... he was\ngettin\u2019 more an\u2019 more powerful \u2014 why\u2019d he go?\n\n\u201cSome say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno\nif he had enough human left in him to die. Some say\nhe\u2019s still out there, bidin\u2019 his time, like, but I don\u2019\nbelieve it. People who was on his side came back ter\n\n\n\nPage | 63 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nours. Some of \u2019em came outta kinda trances. Don\u2019\nreckon they could\u2019ve done if he was cornin\u2019 back.\n\n\u201cMost of us reckon he\u2019s still out there somewhere but\nlost his powers. Too weak to carry on. \u2019Cause\nsomethin\u2019 about you finished him, Harry. There was\nsomethin\u2019 goin\u2019 on that night he hadn\u2019t counted on \u2014\n/ dunno what it was, no one does \u2014 but somethin\u2019\nabout you stumped him, all right.\u201d\n\nHagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect\nblazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling\npleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a\nhorrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he\npossibly be? He\u2019d spent his life being clouted by\nDudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle\nVernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn\u2019t they\nbeen turned into warty toads every time they\u2019d tried\nto lock him in his cupboard? If he\u2019d once defeated the\ngreatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had\nalways been able to kick him around like a football?\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cI think you must have\nmade a mistake. I don\u2019t think I can be a wizard.\u201d\n\nTo his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.\n\n\u201cNot a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when\nyou was scared or angry?\u201d\n\nHarry looked into the fire. Now he came to think\nabout it . . . every odd thing that had ever made his\naunt and uncle furious with him had happened when\nhe, Harry, had been upset or angry ... chased by\nDudley\u2019s gang, he had somehow found himself out of\ntheir reach . . . dreading going to school with that\nridiculous haircut, he\u2019d managed to make it grow\nback . . . and the very last time Dudley had hit him,\n\n\n\nPage | 64 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nhadn\u2019t he got his revenge, without even realizing he\nwas doing it? Hadn\u2019t he set a boa constrictor on him?\n\n\n\nHarry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that\nHagrid was positively beaming at him.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cHarry Potter, not a wizard \u2014 you\nwait, you\u2019ll be right famous at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\nBut Uncle Vernon wasn\u2019t going to give in without a\nfight.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t I told you he\u2019s not going?\u201d he hissed. \u201cHe\u2019s\ngoing to Stonewall High and he\u2019ll be grateful for it. I\u2019ve\nread those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish \u2014\nspell books and wands and \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cIf he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won\u2019t stop\nhim,\u201d growled Hagrid. \u201cStop Lily an\u2019 James Potter\u2019s\nson goin\u2019 ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name\u2019s been\ndown ever since he was born. He\u2019s off ter the finest\nschool of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven\nyears there and he won\u2019t know himself. He\u2019ll be with\nyoungsters of his own sort, fer a change, an\u2019 he\u2019ll be\nunder the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had,\nAlbus Dumbled \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cI AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD\nFOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!\u201d yelled Uncle\nVernon.\n\nBut he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his\numbrella and whirled it over his head, \u201cNEVER \u2014 \u201d he\nthundered, \u201c\u2014 INSULT \u2014 ALBUS \u2014 DUMBLEDORE\n\u2014 IN \u2014 FRONT \u2014 OF \u2014 ME!\u201d\n\nHe brought the umbrella swishing down through the\nair to point at Dudley \u2014 there was a flash of violet\nlight, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and\n\nPage | 65 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nthe next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with\nhis hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in\npain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a\ncurly pig\u2019s tail poking through a hole in his trousers.\n\nUncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and\nDudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified\nlook at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them.\n\nHagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his\nbeard.\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019ta lost me temper,\u201d he said ruefully, \u201cbut it\ndidn\u2019t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig,\nbut I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there\nwasn\u2019t much left ter do.\u201d\n\nHe cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy\neyebrows.\n\n\u201cBe grateful if yeh didn\u2019t mention that ter anyone at\nHogwarts,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m \u2014 er \u2014 not supposed ter do\nmagic, strictly speakin\u2019. I was allowed ter do a bit ter\nfollow yeh an\u2019 get yer letters to yeh an\u2019 stuff \u2014 one o\u2019\nthe reasons I was so keen ter take on the job \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you supposed to do magic?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cOh, well \u2014 I was at Hogwarts meself but I \u2014 er \u2014\ngot expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year.\nThey snapped me wand in half an\u2019 everything. But\nDumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great\nman, Dumbledore.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy were you expelled?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gettin\u2019 late and we\u2019ve got lots ter do tomorrow,\u201d\nsaid Hagrid loudly. \u201cGotta get up ter town, get all yer\nbooks an\u2019 that.\u201d\n\nPage | 66 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nHe took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou can kip under that,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019 mind if it\nwriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o\u2019 dormice in\none o\u2019 the pockets.\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 67 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\nDIAGON ALLY\n\nHarry woke early the next morning. Although he\ncould tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.\n\n\u201cIt was a dream,\u201d he told himself firmly. \u201cI dreamed a\ngiant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a\nschool for wizards. When I open my eyes I\u2019ll be at\nhome in my cupboard.\u201d\n\nThere was suddenly a loud tapping noise.\n\nAnd there\u2019s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry\nthought, his heart sinking. But he still didn\u2019t open his\neyes. It had been such a good dream.\n\nTap. Tap. Tap.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Harry mumbled, \u201cI\u2019m getting up.\u201d\n\nHe sat up and Hagrid \u2019s heavy coat fell off him. The\nhut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid\nhimself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there\n\n\n\nPage | 68 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\nwas an owl rapping its claw on the window, a\nnewspaper held in its beak.\n\nHarry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as\nthough a large balloon was swelling inside him. He\nwent straight to the window and jerked it open. The\nowl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of\nHagrid, who didn\u2019t wake up. The owl then fluttered\nonto the floor and began to attack Hagrid \u2019s coat.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nHarry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it\nsnapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on\nsavaging the coat.\n\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d said Harry loudly. \u201cThere\u2019s an owl \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cPay him,\u201d Hagrid grunted into the sofa.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wants payin\u2019 fer deliverin\u2019 the paper. Look in the\npockets.\u201d\n\nHagrid \u2019s coat seemed to be made of nothing but\npockets \u2014 bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of\nstring, peppermint humbugs, teabags ... finally, Harry\npulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.\n\n\u201cGive him five Knuts,\u201d said Hagrid sleepily.\n\n\u201cKnuts?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe little bronze ones.\u201d\n\nHarry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl\nheld out his leg so Harry could put the money into a\n\n\n\nPage | 69 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nsmall leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off\nthrough the open window.\n\nHagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.\n\n\u201cBest be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter\nLondon an\u2019 buy all yer stuff fer school.\u201d\n\nHarry was turning over the wizard coins and looking\nat them. He had just thought of something that made\nhim feel as though the happy balloon inside him had\ngot a puncture.\n\n\u201cUrn \u2014 Hagrid?\u201d\n\n\u201cMm?\u201d said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge\nboots.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got any money \u2014 and you heard Uncle\nVernon last night ... he won\u2019t pay for me to go and\nlearn magic.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that,\u201d said Hagrid, standing up\nand scratching his head. \u201cD\u2019yeh think yer parents\ndidn\u2019t leave yeh anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if their house was destroyed \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019 keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah,\nfirst stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards\u2019 bank. Have a\nsausage, they\u2019re not bad cold \u2014 an\u2019 I wouldn\u2019 say no\nteh a bit o\u2019 yer birthday cake, neither.\u201d\n\n\u201cWizards have banks?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.\u201d\n\nHarry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.\n\n\n\nPage | 70 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGoblins?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah \u2014 so yeh\u2019d be mad ter try an\u2019 rob it, I\u2019ll tell yeh\nthat. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the\nsafest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter\nkeep safe \u2014 \u2019cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o\u2019\nfact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore.\nHogwarts business.\u201d Hagrid drew himself up proudly.\n\u201cHe usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him.\nFetchin\u2019 you \u2014 gettin\u2019 things from Gringotts \u2014 knows\nhe can trust me, see.\n\n\u201cGot everythin\u2019? Come on, then.\u201d\n\nHarry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was\nquite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight.\nThe boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with\na lot of water in the bottom after the storm.\n\n\u201cHow did you get here?\u201d Harry asked, looking around\nfor another boat.\n\n\u201cFlew,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cFlew?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah \u2014 but we\u2019ll go back in this. Not s\u2019pposed ter\nuse magic now I\u2019ve got yeh.\u201d\n\nThey settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at\nHagrid, trying to imagine him flying.\n\n\u201cSeems a shame ter row, though,\u201d said Hagrid, giving\nHarry another of his sideways looks. \u201cIf I was ter \u2014 er\n\u2014 speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not\nmentionin\u2019 it at Hogwarts?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d said Harry, eager to see more magic.\nHagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it\n\nPage | 71 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\ntwice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward\nland.\n\n\u201cWhy would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?\u201d\nHarry asked.\n\n\u201cSpells \u2014 enchantments,\u201d said Hagrid, unfolding his\nnewspaper as he spoke. \u201cThey say there\u2019s dragons\nguardin\u2019 the high-security vaults. And then yeh gotta\nfind yer way \u2014 Gringotts is hundreds of miles under\nLondon, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh\u2019d die\nof hunger tryin\u2019 ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter\nget yer hands on summat.\u201d\n\nHarry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read\nhis newspaper, the Daily Prophet Harry had learned\nfrom Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone\nwhile they did this, but it was very difficult, he\u2019d\nnever had so many questions in his life.\n\n\u201cMinistry o\u2019 Magic messin\u2019 things up as usual,\u201d Hagrid\nmuttered, turning the page.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a Ministry of Magic?\u201d Harry asked, before he\ncould stop himself.\n\n\u201c \u2019Course,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cThey wanted Dumbledore fer\nMinister, o\u2019 course, but he\u2019d never leave Hogwarts, so\nold Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there\nwas one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every\nmorning, askin\u2019 fer advice.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what does a Ministry of Magic do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles\nthat there\u2019s still witches an\u2019 wizards up an\u2019 down the\ncountry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nPage | 72 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy? Blimey, Harry, everyone \u2019d be wantin\u2019 magic\nsolutions to their problems. Nah, we\u2019re best left\nalone.\u201d\n\nAt this moment the boat bumped gently into the\nharbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and\nthey clambered up the stone steps onto the street.\n\nPassersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked\nthrough the little town to the station. Harry couldn\u2019t\nblame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as\nanyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary\nthings like parking meters and saying loudly, \u201cSee\nthat, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep\nup, \u201cdid you say there are dragons at Gringotts?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, so they say,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cCrikey, I\u2019d like a\ndragon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d like one?\u201d\n\n\u201cWanted one ever since I was a kid \u2014 here we go.\u201d\n\nThey had reached the station. There was a train to\nLondon in five minutes\u2019 time. Hagrid, who didn\u2019t\nunderstand \u201cMuggle money,\u201d as he called it, gave the\nbills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.\n\nPeople stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid\ntook up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a\ncanary-yellow circus tent.\n\n\u201cStill got yer letter, Harry?\u201d he asked as he counted\nstitches.\n\nHarry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.\n\n\n\nPage | 73 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cThere\u2019s a list there of everything\nyeh need.\u201d\n\n\n\nHarry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn\u2019t\nnoticed the night before, and read:\n\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL\no/WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\n\nUNIFORM\n\n\n\nFirst-year students will require:\n\n1 .

Although\nHagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was\nobviously not used to getting there in an ordinary\nway. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the\nUnderground, and complained loudly that the seats\nwere too small and the trains too slow.\n\nPage | 75 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how the Muggles manage without\nmagic,\u201d he said as they climbed a broken-down\nescalator that led up to a bustling road lined with\nshops.\n\nHagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily;\nall Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They\npassed book shops and music stores, hamburger\nrestaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as\nif it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an\nordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there\nreally be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath\nthem? Were there really shops that sold spell books\nand broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge\njoke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn\u2019t\nknown that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he\nmight have thought so; yet somehow, even though\neverything Hagrid had told him so far was\nunbelievable, Harry couldn\u2019t help trusting him.\n\n\u201cThis is it,\u201d said Hagrid, coming to a halt, \u201cthe Leaky\nCauldron. It\u2019s a famous place.\u201d\n\nIt was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn\u2019t\npointed it out, Harry wouldn\u2019t have noticed it was\nthere. The people hurrying by didn\u2019t glance at it. Their\neyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the\nrecord shop on the other as if they couldn\u2019t see the\nLeaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most\npeculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it.\nBefore he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him\ninside.\n\nFor a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A\nfew old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny\nglasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long\npipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old\nbartender, who was quite bald and looked like a\ntoothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped\nPage | 76 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nwhen they walked in. Everyone seemed to know\nHagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the\nbartender reached for a glass, saying, \u201cThe usual,\nHagrid?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t, Tom, I\u2019m on Hogwarts business,\u201d said Hagrid,\nclapping his great hand on Harry\u2019s shoulder and\nmaking Harry\u2019s knees buckle.\n\n\u201cGood Lord,\u201d said the bartender, peering at Harry, \u201cis\nthis \u2014 can this be \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nThe Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely\nstill and silent.\n\n\u201cBless my soul,\u201d whispered the old bartender, \u201cHarry\nPotter ... what an honor.\u201d\n\nHe hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward\nHarry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes.\n\n\u201cWelcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.\u201d\n\nHarry didn\u2019t know what to say. Everyone was looking\nat him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it\nwithout realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was\nbeaming.\n\nThen there was a great scraping of chairs and the\nnext moment, Harry found himself shaking hands\nwith everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.\n\n\u201cDoris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can\u2019t believe I\u2019m meeting\nyou at last.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo proud, Mr. Potter, I\u2019m just so proud.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways wanted to shake your hand \u2014 I\u2019m all of a\nflutter.\u201d\n\nPage | 77 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDelighted, Mr. Potter, just can\u2019t tell you, Diggle\u2019s the\nname, Dedalus Diggle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen you before!\u201d said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle\u2019s\ntop hat fell off in his excitement. \u201cYou bowed to me\nonce in a shop.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe remembers!\u201d cried Dedalus Diggle, looking\naround at everyone. \u201cDid you hear that? He\nremembers me!\u201d\n\nHarry shook hands again and again \u2014 Doris\nCrockford kept coming back for more.\n\nA pale young man made his way forward, very\nnervously. One of his eyes was twitching.\n\n\u201cProfessor Quirrell!\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cHarry, Professor\nQuirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\n\u201cP-P-Potter,\u201d stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping\nHarry\u2019s hand, \u201cc-can\u2019t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to\nmeet you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?\u201d\n\n\u201cD-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,\u201d muttered\nProfessor Quirrell, as though he\u2019d rather not think\nabout it. \u201cN-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?\u201d\n\nHe laughed nervously. \u201cYou\u2019ll be g-getting all your\nequipment, I suppose? I\u2019ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-\nbook on vampires, m-myself.\u201d He looked terrified at\nthe very thought.\n\nBut the others wouldn\u2019t let Professor Quirrell keep\nHarry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get\naway from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make\nhimself heard over the babble.\n\n\n\nPage | 78 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMust get on \u2014 lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.\u201d\n\nDoris Crockford shook Harry\u2019s hand one last time,\nand Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a\nsmall, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but\na trash can and a few weeds.\n\nHagrid grinned at Harry.\n\n\u201cTold yeh, didn\u2019t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even\nProfessor Quirrell was tremblin\u2019 ter meet yeh \u2014 mind\nyou, he\u2019s usually tremblin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he always that nervous?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine\nwhile he was studyin\u2019 outta books but then he took a\nyear off ter get some firsthand experience. ... They say\nhe met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a\nnasty bit o\u2019 trouble with a hag \u2014 never been the same\nsince. Scared of the students, scared of his own\nsubject \u2014 now, where\u2019s me umbrella?\u201d\n\nVampires? Hags? Harry\u2019s head was swimming.\n\nHagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall\nabove the trash can.\n\n\u201cThree up ... two across ...\u201d he muttered. \u201cRight,\nstand back, Harry.\u201d\n\nHe tapped the wall three times with the point of his\numbrella.\n\nThe brick he had touched quivered \u2014 it wriggled \u2014 in\nthe middle, a small hole appeared \u2014 it grew wider\nand wider \u2014 a second later they were facing an\narchway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway\nonto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of\nsight.\n\nPage | 79 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cto Diagon Alley.\u201d\n\nHe grinned at Harry\u2019s amazement. They stepped\nthrough the archway. Harry looked quickly over his\nshoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back\ninto solid wall.\n\nThe sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons\noutside the nearest shop. Cauldrons \u2014 All Sizes \u2014\nCopper, Brass, Pewter, Silver \u2014 Self-Stirring \u2014\nCollapsible, said a sign hanging over them.\n\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019ll be needin\u2019 one,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cbut we\ngotta get yer money first.\u201d\n\nHarry wished he had about eight more eyes. He\nturned his head in every direction as they walked up\nthe street, trying to look at everything at once: the\nshops, the things outside them, the people doing their\nshopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary\nwas shaking her head as they passed, saying,\n\n\u201cDragon liver, sixteen Sickles an ounce, they\u2019re mad.\u201d\n\nA low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign\nsaying Eeylops Owl Emporium \u2014 Tawny, Screech,\nBarn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about\nHarry\u2019s age had their noses pressed against a window\nwith broomsticks in it. \u201cLook,\u201d Harry heard one of\nthem say, \u201cthe new Nimbus Two Thousand \u2014 fastest\never \u2014 \u201d There were shops selling robes, shops selling\ntelescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had\nnever seen before, windows stacked with barrels of\nbat spleens and eels\u2019 eyes, tottering piles of spell\nbooks, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles,\nglobes of the moon. ...\n\n\u201cGringotts,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\n\nPage | 80 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nThey had reached a snowy white building that\ntowered over the other little shops. Standing beside\nits burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of\nscarlet and gold, was \u2014\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s a goblin,\u201d said Hagrid quietly as they\nwalked up the white stone steps toward him. The\ngoblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a\nswarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry\nnoticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they\nwalked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of\ndoors, silver this time, with words engraved upon\nthem:\n\nEnter, stranger, but take heed\n\nOf what awaits the sin of greed,\n\nFor those who take, but do not earn,\n\nMust pay most dearly in their turn.\n\nSo if you seek beneath our floors\n\nA treasure that was never yours,\n\nThief, you have been warned, beware\n\nOf finding more than treasure there.\n\n\u201cLike I said, yeh\u2019d be mad ter try an\u2019 rob it,\u201d said\nHagrid.\n\nA pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors\nand they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred\nmore goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long\ncounter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in\nbrass scales, examining precious stones through\neyeglasses. There were too many doors to count\nPage | 81 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nleading off the hall, and yet more goblins were\nshowing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry\nmade for the counter.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d said Hagrid to a free goblin. \u201cWe\u2019ve come\nter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter\u2019s safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have his key, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cGot it here somewhere,\u201d said Hagrid, and he started\nemptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a\nhandful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of\nnumbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry\nwatched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of\nrubies as big as glowing coals.\n\n\u201cGot it,\u201d said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden\nkey.\n\nThe goblin looked at it closely.\n\n\u201cThat seems to be in order.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn\u2019 I\u2019ve also got a letter here from Professor\nDumbledore,\u201d said Hagrid importantly, throwing out\nhis chest. \u201cIt\u2019s about the You-Know-What in vault\nseven hundred and thirteen.\u201d\n\nThe goblin read the letter carefully.\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \u201cI will\nhave someone take you down to both vaults.\nGriphook!\u201d\n\nGriphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had\ncrammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets,\nhe and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the\ndoors leading off the hall.\n\n\n\nPage | 82 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred\nand thirteen?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t tell yeh that,\u201d said Hagrid mysteriously. \u201cVery\nsecret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore\u2019s trusted me.\nMore\u2019n my job\u2019s worth ter tell yeh that.\u201d\n\nGriphook held the door open for them. Harry, who\nhad expected more marble, was surprised. They were\nin a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming\ntorches. It sloped steeply downward and there were\nlittle railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled\nand a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward\nthem. They climbed in \u2014 Hagrid with some difficulty\n\u2014 and were off.\n\nAt first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting\npassages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right,\nleft, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The\nrattling cart seemed to know its own way, because\nGriphook wasn\u2019t steering.\n\nHarry\u2019s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them,\nbut he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw\na burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted\naround to see if it was a dragon, but too late \u2014 they\nplunged even deeper, passing an underground lake\nwhere huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the\nceiling and floor.\n\n\u201cI never know,\u201d Harry called to Hagrid over the noise\nof the cart, \u201cwhat\u2019s the difference between a\nstalagmite and a stalactite?\u201d\n\n\u201cStalagmite\u2019s got an \u2018m\u2019 in it,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAn\u2019 don\u2019\nask me questions just now, I think I\u2019m gonna be\nsick.\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 83 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nHe did look very green, and when the cart stopped at\nlast beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid\ngot out and had to lean against the wall to stop his\nknees from trembling.\n\nGriphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke\ncame billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped.\nInside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver.\nHeaps of little bronze Knuts.\n\n\u201cAll yours,\u201d smiled Hagrid.\n\nAll Harry\u2019s \u2014 it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn\u2019t\nhave known about this or they\u2019d have had it from him\nfaster than blinking. How often had they complained\nhow much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time\nthere had been a small fortune belonging to him,\nburied deep under London.\n\nHagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.\n\n\u201cThe gold ones are Galleons,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cSeventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine\nKnuts to a Sickle, it\u2019s easy enough. Right, that should\nbe enough fer a couple o\u2019 terms, we\u2019ll keep the rest\nsafe for yeh.\u201d He turned to Griphook. \u201cVault seven\nhundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go\nmore slowly?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne speed only,\u201d said Griphook.\n\nThey were going even deeper now and gathering\nspeed. The air became colder and colder as they\nhurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over\nan underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the\nside to try to see what was down at the dark bottom,\nbut Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff\nof his neck.\n\n\n\nPage | 84 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nVault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.\n\n\u201cStand back,\u201d said Griphook importantly. He stroked\nthe door gently with one of his long fingers and it\nsimply melted away.\n\n\u201cIf anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they\u2019d be\nsucked through the door and trapped in there,\u201d said\nGriphook.\n\n\u201cHow often do you check to see if anyone\u2019s inside?\u201d\nHarry asked.\n\n\u201cAbout once every ten years,\u201d said Griphook with a\nrather nasty grin.\n\nSomething really extraordinary had to be inside this\ntop security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned\nforward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at\nthe very least \u2014 but at first he thought it was empty.\nThen he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up\nin brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up\nand tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to\nknow what it was, but knew better than to ask.\n\n\u201cCome on, back in this infernal cart, and don\u2019t talk to\nme on the way back, it\u2019s best if I keep me mouth\nshut,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\n\nOne wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the\nsunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn\u2019t know where\nto run first now that he had a bag full of money. He\ndidn\u2019t have to know how many Galleons there were to\na pound to know that he was holding more money\nthan he\u2019d had in his whole life \u2014 more money than\neven Dudley had ever had.\n\n\n\nPage | 85 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMight as well get yer uniform,\u201d said Hagrid, nodding\ntoward Madam Malkin\u2019s Robes for All Occasions.\n\u201cListen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a\npick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them\nGringotts carts.\u201d He did still look a bit sick, so Harry\nentered Madam Malkin\u2019s shop alone, feeling nervous.\n\nMadam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all\nin mauve.\n\n\u201cHogwarts, dear?\u201d she said, when Harry started to\nspeak. \u201cGot the lot here \u2014 another young man being\nfitted up just now, in fact.\u201d\n\nIn the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed\nface was standing on a footstool while a second witch\npinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood\nHarry on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over\nhis head, and began to pin it to the right length.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d said the boy, \u201cHogwarts, too?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cMy father\u2019s next door buying my books and mother\u2019s\nup the street looking at wands,\u201d said the boy. He had\na bored, drawling voice. \u201cThen I\u2019m going to drag them\noff to look at racing brooms. I don\u2019t see why first years\ncan\u2019t have their own. I think I\u2019ll bully father into\ngetting me one and I\u2019ll smuggle it in somehow.\u201d\n\nHarry was strongly reminded of Dudley.\n\n\u201cHave you got your own broom?\u201d the boy went on.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cPlay Quidditch at all?\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 86 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said again, wondering what on earth\nQuidditch could be.\n\n\u201c I do \u2014 Father says it\u2019s a crime if I\u2019m not picked to\nplay for my House, and I must say, I agree. Know\nwhat House you 11 be in yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.\n\n\u201cWell, no one really knows until they get there, do\nthey, but I know I\u2019ll be in Slytherin, all our family\nhave been \u2014 imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I\u2019d\nleave, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cMmm,\u201d said Harry, wishing he could say something a\nbit more interesting.\n\n\u201cI say, look at that man!\u201d said the boy suddenly,\nnodding toward the front window. Hagrid was\nstanding there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two\nlarge ice creams to show he couldn\u2019t come in.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Hagrid,\u201d said Harry, pleased to know\nsomething the boy didn\u2019t. \u201cHe works at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said the boy, \u201cI\u2019ve heard of him. He\u2019s a sort of\nservant, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the gamekeeper,\u201d said Harry. He was liking the\nboy less and less every second.\n\n\u201cYes, exactly. I heard he\u2019s a sort of savage \u2014 lives in a\nhut on the school grounds and every now and then he\ngets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire\nto his bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s brilliant,\u201d said Harry coldly.\n\n\n\nPage | 87 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you?\u201d said the boy, with a slight sneer. \u201cWhy is he\nwith you? Where are your parents?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re dead,\u201d said Harry shortly. He didn\u2019t feel\nmuch like going into the matter with this boy.\n\n\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d said the other, not sounding sorry at all.\n\u201cBut they were our kind, weren\u2019t they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were a witch and wizard, if that\u2019s what you\nmean.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think they should let the other sort in,\ndo you? They\u2019re just not the same, they\u2019ve never been\nbrought up to know our ways. Some of them have\nnever even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter,\nimagine. I think they should keep it in the old\nwizarding families. What\u2019s your surname, anyway?\u201d\n\nBut before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said,\n\u201cThat\u2019s you done, my dear,\u201d and Harry, not sorry for\nan excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down\nfrom the footstool.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,\u201d said the\ndrawling boy.\n\nHarry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid\nhad bought him (chocolate and raspberry with\nchopped nuts).\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment\nand quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a\nbottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When\nthey had left the shop, he said, \u201cHagrid, what\u2019s\nQuidditch?\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 88 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBlimey, Harry, I keep forgettin\u2019 how little yeh know \u2014\nnot knowin\u2019 about Quidditch!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me feel worse,\u201d said Harry. He told\nHagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin\u2019s.\n\n\u201c \u2014 and he said people from Muggle families shouldn\u2019t\neven be allowed in \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cYer not from a Muggle family. If he\u2019d known who yeh\nwere \u2014 he\u2019s grown up knowin\u2019 yer name if his\nparents are wizardin\u2019 folk. You saw what everyone in\nthe Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh.\nAnyway, what does he know about it, some o\u2019 the best\nI ever saw were the only ones with magic in \u2019em in a\nlong line o\u2019 Muggles \u2014 look at yer mum! Look what\nshe had fer a sister!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what is Quidditch?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our sport. Wizard sport. It\u2019s like \u2014 like soccer in\nthe Muggle world \u2014 everyone follows Quidditch \u2014\nplayed up in the air on broomsticks and there\u2019s four\nballs \u2014 sorta hard ter explain the rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?\u201d\n\n\u201cSchool Houses. There\u2019s four. Everyone says\nHufflepuff are a lot o\u2019 duffers, but \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cI bet I\u2019m in Hufflepuff,\u201d said Harry gloomily.\n\n\u201cBetter Hufflepuff than Slytherin,\u201d said Hagrid darkly.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a single witch or wizard who went bad\nwho wasn\u2019t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.\u201d\n\n\u201cVol-, sorry \u2014 You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?\u201d\n\n\u201cYears an\u2019 years ago,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\nPage | 89 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nThey bought Harry\u2019s school books in a shop called\nFlourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to\nthe ceiling with books as large as paving stones\nbound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in\ncovers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a\nfew books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley,\nwho never read anything, would have been wild to get\nhis hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to\ndrag Harry away from Curses and Counter-curses\n(Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies\nwith the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs,\nTongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor\nVindictus Viridian.\n\n\u201cI was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sayin\u2019 that\u2019s not a good idea, but yer not ter\nuse magic in the Muggle world except in very special\ncircumstances,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAn\u2019 anyway, yeh\ncouldn\u2019 work any of them curses yet, yeh\u2019ll need a lot\nmore study before yeh get ter that level.\u201d\n\nHagrid wouldn\u2019t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron,\neither (\u201cIt says pewter on yer list\u201d), but they got a nice\nset of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a\ncollapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the\nApothecary, which was fascinating enough to make\nup for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and\nrotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the\nfloor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders\nlined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs,\nand snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While\nHagrid asked the man behind the counter for a\nsupply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry,\nHarry himself examined silver unicorn horns at\ntwenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-\nblack beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).\n\n\n\nPage | 90 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nOutside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry\u2019s list\nagain.\n\n\u201cJust yer wand left \u2014 oh yeah, an\u2019 I still haven\u2019t got\nyeh a birthday present.\u201d\n\nHarry felt himself go red.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cI know I don\u2019t have to. Tell yeh what, I\u2019ll get yer\nanimal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years\nago, yeh\u2019d be laughed at \u2014 an\u2019 I don\u2019 like cats, they\nmake me sneeze. I\u2019ll get yer an owl. All the kids want\nowls, they\u2019re dead useful, carry yer mail an\u2019\neverythin\u2019.\u201d\n\nTwenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl\nEmporium, which had been dark and full of rustling\nand flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a\nlarge cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep\nwith her head under her wing. He couldn\u2019t stop\nstammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor\nQuirrell.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019 mention it,\u201d said Hagrid gruffly. \u201cDon\u2019 expect\nyou\u2019ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just\nOllivanders left now \u2014 only place fer wands,\nOllivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.\u201d\n\nA magic wand . . . this was what Harry had been really\nlooking forward to.\n\nThe last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold\nletters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine\nWands since 382b. c. A single wand lay on a faded\npurple cushion in the dusty window.\n\n\n\nPage | 91 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nA tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the\nshop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place,\nempty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid\nsat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had\nentered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new\nquestions that had just occurred to him and looked\ninstead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly\nright up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of\nhis neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here\nseemed to tingle with some secret magic.\n\n\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d said a soft voice. Harry jumped.\nHagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a\nloud crunching noise and he got quickly off the\nspindly chair.\n\nAn old man was standing before them, his wide, pale\neyes shining like moons through the gloom of the\nshop.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d said Harry awkwardly.\n\n\u201cAh yes,\u201d said the man. \u201cYes, yes. I thought I\u2019d be\nseeing you soon. Harry Potter.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question.\n\u201cYou have your mother\u2019s eyes. It seems only yesterday\nshe was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten\nand a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow.\nNice wand for charm work.\u201d\n\nMr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished\nhe would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.\n\n\u201cYour father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany\nwand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and\nexcellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father\nfavored it \u2014 it\u2019s really the wand that chooses the\nwizard, of course.\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 92 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nMr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry\nwere almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself\nreflected in those misty eyes.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s where ...\u201d\n\nMr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry\u2019s\nforehead with a long, white finger.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,\u201d he said\nsoftly. \u201cThirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful\nwand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands ... well,\nif I\u2019d known what that wand was going out into the\nworld to do. ...\u201d\n\nHe shook his head and then, to Harry\u2019s relief, spotted\nHagrid.\n\n\u201cRubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again.\n\n... Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was, sir, yes,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cGood wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it\nin half when you got expelled?\u201d said Mr. Ollivander,\nsuddenly stern.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 yes, they did, yes,\u201d said Hagrid, shuffling his\nfeet. \u201cI\u2019ve still got the pieces, though,\u201d he added\nbrightly.\n\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t use them?\u201d said Mr. Ollivander\nsharply.\n\n\u201cOh, no, sir,\u201d said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he\ngripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke.\n\n\u201cHmmm,\u201d said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a\npiercing look. \u201cWell, now \u2014 Mr. Potter. Let me see.\u201d\n\nPage | 93 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nHe pulled a long tape measure with silver markings\nout of his pocket. \u201cWhich is your wand arm?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 well, I\u2019m right-handed,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cHold out your arm. That\u2019s it.\u201d He measured Harry\nfrom shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder\nto floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he\nmeasured, he said, \u201cEvery Ollivander wand has a core\nof a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use\nunicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the\nheartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are\nthe same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or\nphoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will\nnever get such good results with another wizard\u2019s\nwand.\u201d\n\nHarry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which\nwas measuring between his nostrils, was doing this\non its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the\nshelves, taking down boxes.\n\n\u201cThat will do,\u201d he said, and the tape measure\ncrumpled into a heap on the floor. \u201cRight then, Mr.\nPotter. Try this one. Beech-wood and dragon\nheartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take\nit and give it a wave.\u201d\n\nHarry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it\naround a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his\nhand almost at once.\n\n\u201cMaple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite\nwhippy. Try \u2014 \u201d\n\nHarry tried \u2014 but he had hardly raised the wand\nwhen it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.\n\n\n\nPage | 94 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, no \u2014 here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a\nhalf inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.\u201d\n\nHarry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr.\nOllivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands\nwas mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair,\nbut the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the\nshelves, the happier he seemed to become.\n\n\u201cTricky customer, eh? Not to worry, well find the\nperfect match here somewhere \u2014 I wonder, now \u2014\nyes, why not \u2014 unusual combination \u2014 holly and\nphoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.\u201d\n\nHarry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his\nfingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it\nswishing down through the dusty air and a stream of\nred and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework,\nthrowing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid\nwhooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, \u201cOh,\nbravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well ...\nhow curious ... how very curious ...\u201d\n\nHe put Harry\u2019s wand back into its box and wrapped it\nin brown paper, still muttering, \u201cCurious . . . curious\n\n\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut what\u2019s curious?\u201d\n\nMr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.\n\n\u201cI remember every wand I\u2019ve ever sold, Mr. Potter.\nEvery single wand. It so happens that the phoenix\nwhose tail feather is in your wand, gave another\nfeather \u2014 just one other. It is very curious indeed\nthat you should be destined for this wand when its\nbrother \u2014 why, its brother gave you that scar.\u201d\n\n\n\nHarry swallowed.\n\nPage | 95 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed\nhow these things happen. The wand chooses the\nwizard, remember. ... I think we must expect great\nthings from you, Mr. Potter. ... After all, He-Who-\nMust-Not-Be-Named did great things \u2014 terrible, yes,\nbut great.\u201d\n\nHarry shivered. He wasn\u2019t sure he liked Mr.\n\nOllivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for\nhis wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his\nshop.\n\nThe late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry\nand Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley,\nback through the wall, back through the Leaky\nCauldron, now empty. Harry didn\u2019t speak at all as\nthey walked down the road; he didn\u2019t even notice how\nmuch people were gawking at them on the\nUnderground, laden as they were with all their funny-\nshaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its\ncage on Harry\u2019s lap. Up another escalator, out into\nPaddington station; Harry only realized where they\nwere when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.\n\n\u201cGot time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nHe bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on\nplastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around.\nEverything looked so strange, somehow.\n\n\u201cYou all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\nHarry wasn\u2019t sure he could explain. He\u2019d just had the\nbest birthday of his life \u2014 and yet \u2014 he chewed his\nhamburger, trying to find the words.\n\n\u201cEveryone thinks I\u2019m special,\u201d he said at last. \u201cAll\nthose people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor\n\nPage | 96 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nQuirrell, Mr. Ollivander ... but I don\u2019t know anything\nabout magic at all. How can they expect great things?\nI\u2019m famous and I can\u2019t even remember what I\u2019m\nfamous for. I don\u2019t know what happened when Vol-,\nsorry \u2014 I mean, the night my parents died.\u201d\n\nHagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard\nand eyebrows he wore a very kind smile.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019 you worry, Harry. You\u2019ll learn fast enough.\nEveryone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you\u2019ll\nbe just fine. Just be yerself. I know it\u2019s hard. Yeh\u2019ve\nbeen singled out, an\u2019 that\u2019s always hard. But yeh\u2019ll\nhave a great time at Hogwarts \u2014 I did \u2014 still do,\n\u2019smatter of fact.\u201d\n\nHagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take\nhim back to the Dursleys, then handed him an\nenvelope.\n\n\u201cYer ticket fer Hogwarts,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst o\u2019 September\n\u2014 King\u2019s Cross \u2014 it\u2019s all on yer ticket. Any problems\nwith the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she\u2019ll\nknow where to find me. ... See yeh soon, Harry.\u201d\n\nThe train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to\nwatch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his\nseat and pressed his nose against the window, but he\nblinked and Hagrid had gone.\n\n\n\nPage | 97 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM\nNINE AND THREE-QUARTERS\n\nHarry\u2019s last month with the Dursleys wasn\u2019t fun.\nTrue, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn\u2019t\nstay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle\nVernon didn\u2019t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him\nto do anything, or shout at him \u2014 in fact, they didn\u2019t\nspeak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they\nacted as though any chair with Harry in it were\nempty. Although this was an improvement in many\nways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.\n\nHarry kept to his room, with his new owl for\ncompany. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name\nhe had found in A History of Magic. His school books\nwere very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late\ninto the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the\nopen window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt\nPetunia didn\u2019t come in to vacuum anymore, because\nHedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night\nbefore he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day\n\n\n\nPage | 98 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\non the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall,\ncounting down to September the first.\n\nOn the last day of August he thought he\u2019d better\nspeak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King\u2019s\nCross station the next day, so he went down to the\nliving room where they were watching a quiz show on\ntelevision. He cleared his throat to let them know he\nwas there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the\nroom.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 Uncle Vernon?\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 I need to be at King\u2019s Cross tomorrow to \u2014 to\ngo to Hogwarts.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon grunted again.\n\n\u201cWould it be all right if you gave me a lift?\u201d\n\nGrunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\nHe was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon\nactually spoke.\n\n\u201cFunny way to get to a wizards\u2019 school, the train.\nMagic carpets all got punctures, have they?\u201d\n\nHarry didn\u2019t say anything.\n\n\u201cWhere is this school, anyway?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Harry, realizing this for the first\ntime. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of\nhis pocket.\n\nPage | 99 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI just take the train from platform nine and three-\nquarters at eleven o\u2019clock,\u201d he read.\n\nHis aunt and uncle stared.\n\n\u201cPlatform what?\u201d\n\n\u201cNine and three-quarters.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk rubbish,\u201d said Uncle Vernon. \u201cThere is no\nplatform nine and three-quarters.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s on my ticket.\u201d\n\n\u201cBarking,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, \u201chowling mad, the lot of\nthem. You 11 see. You just wait. All right, we\u2019ll take\nyou to King\u2019s Cross. We\u2019re going up to London\ntomorrow anyway, or I wouldn\u2019t bother.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are you going to London?\u201d Harry asked, trying\nto keep things friendly.\n\n\u201cTaking Dudley to the hospital,\u201d growled Uncle\nVernon. \u201cGot to have that ruddy tail removed before\nhe goes to Smeltings.\u201d\n\nHarry woke at five o\u2019clock the next morning and was\ntoo excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up\nand pulled on his jeans because he didn\u2019t want to\nwalk into the station in his wizard\u2019s robes \u2014 he\u2019d\nchange on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet\nagain to make sure he had everything he needed, saw\nthat Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then\npaced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up.\nTwo hours later, Harry\u2019s huge, heavy trunk had been\nloaded into the Dursleys\u2019 car, Aunt Petunia had\ntalked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had\nset off.\n\n\n\nPage | 100 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nThey reached King\u2019s Cross at half past ten. Uncle\nVernon dumped Harry\u2019s trunk onto a cart and\nwheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this\nwas strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead,\nfacing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face.\n\n\u201cWell, there you are, boy. Platform nine \u2014 platform\nten. Your platform should be somewhere in the\nmiddle, but they don\u2019t seem to have built it yet, do\nthey?\u201d\n\nHe was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic\nnumber nine over one platform and a big plastic\nnumber ten over the one next to it, and in the middle,\nnothing at all.\n\n\u201cHave a good term,\u201d said Uncle Vernon with an even\nnastier smile. He left without another word. Harry\nturned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of\nthem were laughing. Harry\u2019s mouth went rather dry.\nWhat on earth was he going to do? He was starting to\nattract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He\u2019d\nhave to ask someone.\n\nHe stopped a passing guard, but didn\u2019t dare mention\nplatform nine and three-quarters. The guard had\nnever heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn\u2019t\neven tell him what part of the country it was in, he\nstarted to get annoyed, as though Harry was being\nstupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for\nthe train that left at eleven o\u2019clock, but the guard said\nthere wasn\u2019t one. In the end the guard strode away,\nmuttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying\nhard not to panic. According to the large clock over\nthe arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on\nthe train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it;\nhe was stranded in the middle of a station with a\ntrunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard\nmoney, and a large owl.\n\nPage | 101 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nHagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you\nhad to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to\nget into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get\nout his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector\u2019s\nstand between platforms nine and ten.\n\nAt that moment a group of people passed just behind\nhim and he caught a few words of what they were\nsaying.\n\n\u201c \u2014 packed with Muggles, of course \u2014 \u201d\n\nHarry swung round. The speaker was a plump\nwoman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming\nred hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like\nHarry\u2019s in front of him \u2014 and they had an owl.\n\nHeart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them.\nThey stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear\nwhat they were saying.\n\n\u201cNow, what\u2019s the platform number?\u201d said the boys\u2019\nmother.\n\n\u201cNine and three-quarters!\u201d piped a small girl, also red-\nheaded, who was holding her hand, \u201cMom, can\u2019t I go\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right,\nPercy, you go first.\u201d\n\nWhat looked like the oldest boy marched toward\nplatforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to\nblink in case he missed it \u2014 but just as the boy\nreached the dividing barrier between the two\nplatforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in\nfront of him and by the time the last backpack had\ncleared away, the boy had vanished.\n\n\n\nPage | 102 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFred, you next,\u201d the plump woman said.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not Fred, I\u2019m George,\u201d said the boy. \u201cHonestly,\nwoman, you call yourself our mother? Can\u2019t you tell\nI\u2019m George?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, George, dear.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly joking, I am Fred,\u201d said the boy, and off he\nwent. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he\nmust have done so, because a second later, he had\ngone \u2014 but how had he done it?\n\nNow the third brother was walking briskly toward the\nbarrier \u2014 he was almost there \u2014 and then, quite\nsuddenly, he wasn\u2019t anywhere.\n\nThere was nothing else for it.\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Harry said to the plump woman.\n\n\u201cHello, dear,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst time at Hogwarts? Ron\u2019s\nnew, too.\u201d\n\nShe pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He\nwas tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands\nand feet, and a long nose.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThe thing is \u2014 the thing is, I don\u2019t\nknow how to \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cHow to get onto the platform?\u201d she said kindly, and\nHarry nodded.\n\n\u201cNot to worry,\u201d she said. \u201cAll you have to do is walk\nstraight at the barrier between platforms nine and\nten. Don\u2019t stop and don\u2019t be scared you\u2019ll crash into\nit, that\u2019s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if\nyou\u2019re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.\u201d\n\nPage | 103 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 okay,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe pushed his trolley around and stared at the\nbarrier. It looked very solid.\n\nHe started to walk toward it. People jostled him on\ntheir way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked\nmore quickly. He was going to smash right into that\nbarrier and then he\u2019d be in trouble \u2014 leaning forward\non his cart, he broke into a heavy run \u2014 the barrier\nwas coming nearer and nearer \u2014 he wouldn\u2019t be able\nto stop \u2014 the cart was out of control \u2014 he was a foot\naway \u2014 he closed his eyes ready for the crash \u2014\n\nIt didn\u2019t come ... he kept on running ... he opened his\neyes.\n\nA scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform\npacked with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts\nExpress, eleven o\u2019clock. Harry looked behind him and\nsaw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had\nbeen, with the words Platform Nine and Three-\nQuarters on it. He had done it.\n\nSmoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the\nchattering crowd, while cats of every color wound\nhere and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one\nanother in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble\nand the scraping of heavy trunks.\n\nThe first few carriages were already packed with\nstudents, some hanging out of the window to talk to\ntheir families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed\nhis cart off down the platform in search of an empty\nseat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying,\n\u201cGran, I\u2019ve lost my toad again.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Neville,\u201d he heard the old woman sigh.\n\n\n\nPage | 104 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nA boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small\ncrowd.\n\n\n\n\u201cGive us a look, Lee, go on.\u201d\n\nThe boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the\npeople around him shrieked and yelled as something\ninside poked out a long, hairy leg.\n\nHarry pressed on through the crowd until he found\nan empty compartment near the end of the train. He\nput Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and\nheave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift\nit up the steps but could hardly raise one end and\ntwice he dropped it painfully on his foot.\n\n\u201cWant a hand?\u201d It was one of the red-haired twins\nhe\u2019d followed through the barrier.\n\n\u201cYes, please,\u201d Harry panted.\n\n\u201cOy, Fred! C\u2019mere and help!\u201d\n\nWith the twins\u2019 help, Harry\u2019s trunk was at last tucked\naway in a corner of the compartment.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of\nhis eyes.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d said one of the twins suddenly,\npointing at Harry\u2019s lightning scar.\n\n\u201cBlimey,\u201d said the other twin. \u201cAre you \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is,\u201d said the first twin. \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d he added to\nHarry.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry.\n\nPage | 105 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201c Harry Potter,\u201d chorused the twins.\n\n\u201cOh, him,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI mean, yes, I am.\u201d\n\nThe two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself\nturning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating\nin through the train\u2019s open door.\n\n\u201cFred? George? Are you there?\u201d\n\n\u201cComing, Mom.\u201d\n\nWith a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the\ntrain.\n\nHarry sat down next to the window where, half\nhidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the\nplatform and hear what they were saying. Their\nmother had just taken out her handkerchief.\n\n\u201cRon, you\u2019ve got something on your nose.\u201d\n\nThe youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she\ngrabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose.\n\n\u201cMom \u2014 geroff.\u201d He wriggled free.\n\n\u201cAaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?\u201d\nsaid one of the twins.\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Percy?\u201d said their mother.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s coming now.\u201d\n\nThe oldest boy came striding into sight. He had\nalready changed into his billowing black Hogwarts\n\n\n\nPage | 106 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nrobes, and Harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge\non his chest with the letter P on it.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t stay long, Mother,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m up front, the\nprefects have got two compartments to themselves \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cOh, are you a prefect, Percy?\u201d said one of the twins,\nwith an air of great surprise. \u201cYou should have said\nsomething, we had no idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cHang on, I think I remember him saying something\nabout it,\u201d said the other twin. \u201cOnce \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cOr twice \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cA minute \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cAll summer \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d said Percy the Prefect.\n\n\u201cHow come Percy gets new robes, anyway?\u201d said one\nof the twins.\n\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s a prefect,\u201d said their mother fondly. \u201cAll\nright, dear, well, have a good term \u2014 send me an owl\nwhen you get there.\u201d\n\nShe kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she\nturned to the twins.\n\n\u201cNow, you two \u2014 this year, you behave yourselves. If I\nget one more owl telling me you\u2019ve \u2014 you\u2019ve blown up\na toilet or \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cBlown up a toilet? We\u2019ve never blown up a toilet.\u201d\n\u201cGreat idea though, thanks, Mom.\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 107 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not funny. And look after Ron.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d said Ron again. He was almost as tall as\nthe twins already and his nose was still pink where\nhis mother had rubbed it.\n\n\u201cHey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on\nthe train?\u201d\n\nHarry leaned back quickly so they couldn\u2019t see him\nlooking.\n\n\u201cYou know that black-haired boy who was near us in\nthe station? Know who he is?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201c Harry Potted\u201d\n\nHarry heard the little girl\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cOh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom,\noh please. ...\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy\nisn\u2019t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really,\nFred? How do you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cAsked him. Saw his scar. It\u2019s really there \u2014 like\nlightning.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoor dear \u2014 no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He\nwas ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the\nplatform.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind that, do you think he remembers what\nYou-Know-Who looks like?\u201d\n\nPage | 108 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nTheir mother suddenly became very stern.\n\n\n\n\u201cI forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don\u2019t you dare. As\nthough he needs reminding of that on his first day at\nschool.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, keep your hair on.\u201d\n\nA whistle sounded.\n\n\u201cHurry up!\u201d their mother said, and the three boys\nclambered onto the train. They leaned out of the\nwindow for her to kiss them good-bye, and their\nyounger sister began to cry.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t, Ginny, we\u2019ll send you loads of owls.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.\u201d\n\n\u201c Georg e\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly joking, Mom.\u201d\n\nThe train began to move. Harry saw the boys\u2019 mother\nwaving and their sister, half laughing, half crying,\nrunning to keep up with the train until it gathered too\nmuch speed, then she fell back and waved.\n\nHarry watched the girl and her mother disappear as\nthe train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the\nwindow. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He\ndidn\u2019t know what he was going to \u2014 but it had to be\nbetter than what he was leaving behind.\n\nThe door of the compartment slid open and the\nyoungest redheaded boy came in.\n\n\u201cAnyone sitting there?\u201d he asked, pointing at the seat\nopposite Harry. \u201cEverywhere else is full.\u201d\n\nPage | 109 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nHarry shook his head and the boy sat down. He\nglanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the\nwindow, pretending he hadn\u2019t looked. Harry saw he\nstill had a black mark on his nose.\n\n\u201cHey, Ron.\u201d\n\nThe twins were back.\n\n\u201cListen, we\u2019re going down the middle of the train \u2014\n\nLee Jordan\u2019s got a giant tarantula down there.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d mumbled Ron.\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said the other twin, \u201cdid we introduce\nourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron,\nour brother. See you later, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cBye,\u201d said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the\ncompartment door shut behind them.\n\n\u201cAre you really Harry Potter?\u201d Ron blurted out.\n\nHarry nodded.\n\n\u201cOh \u2014 well, I thought it might be one of Fred and\nGeorge\u2019s jokes,\u201d said Ron. \u201cAnd have you really got \u2014\nyou know ...\u201d\n\nHe pointed at Harry\u2019s forehead.\n\nHarry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning\nscar. Ron stared.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s where You-Know-Who \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut I can\u2019t remember it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing?\u201d said Ron eagerly.\n\nPage | 110 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWell \u2014 I remember a lot of green light, but nothing\nelse.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few\nmoments, then, as though he had suddenly realized\nwhat he was doing, he looked quickly out of the\nwindow again.\n\n\u201cAre all your family wizards?\u201d asked Harry, who found\nRon just as interesting as Ron found him.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 yes, I think so,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI think Mom\u2019s got a\nsecond cousin who\u2019s an accountant, but we never talk\nabout him.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you must know loads of magic already.\u201d\n\nThe Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding\nfamilies the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked\nabout.\n\n\u201cI heard you went to live with Muggles,\u201d said Ron.\n\u201cWhat are they like?\u201d\n\n\u201cHorrible \u2014 well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle\nand cousin are, though. Wish I\u2019d had three wizard\nbrothers.\u201d\n\n\u201cFive,\u201d said Ron. For some reason, he was looking\ngloomy. \u201cI\u2019m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts.\nYou could say I\u2019ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and\nCharlie have already left \u2014 Bill was head boy and\nCharlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy\u2019s a\nprefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they\nstill get really good marks and everyone thinks they\u2019re\nreally funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the\nothers, but if I do, it\u2019s no big deal, because they did it\nfirst. You never get anything new, either, with five\n\nPage | 111 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nbrothers. I\u2019ve got Bill\u2019s old robes, Charlie\u2019s old wand,\nand Percy\u2019s old rat.\u201d\n\nRon reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat\ngray rat, which was asleep.\n\n\u201cHis name\u2019s Scabbers and he\u2019s useless, he hardly ever\nwakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being\nmade a prefect, but they couldn\u2019t aff \u2014 I mean, I got\nScabbers instead.\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s ears went pink. He seemed to think he\u2019d said\ntoo much, because he went back to staring out of the\nwindow.\n\nHarry didn\u2019t think there was anything wrong with not\nbeing able to afford an owl. After all, he\u2019d never had\nany money in his life until a month ago, and he told\nRon so, all about having to wear Dudley\u2019s old clothes\nand never getting proper birthday presents. This\nseemed to cheer Ron up.\n\n"... and until Hagrid told me, I didn\u2019t know anything\nabout being a wizard or about my parents or\nVoldemort \u2014 \u201d\n\nRon gasped.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201c You said You-Know-Who\u2019s name\u201d said Ron, sounding\nboth shocked and impressed. \u201cI\u2019d have thought you,\nof all people \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the\nname,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI just never knew you shouldn\u2019t.\nSee what I mean? I\u2019ve got loads to learn. ... I bet,\u201d he\nadded, voicing for the first time something that had\n\n\n\nPage | 112 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nbeen worrying him a lot lately, \u201cI bet I\u2019m the worst in\nthe class.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be. There\u2019s loads of people who come from\nMuggle families and they learn quick enough.\u201d\n\nWhile they had been talking, the train had carried\nthem out of London. Now they were speeding past\nfields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a\ntime, watching the fields and lanes flick past.\n\nAround half past twelve there was a great clattering\noutside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman\nslid back their door and said, \u201cAnything off the cart,\ndears?\u201d\n\nHarry, who hadn\u2019t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet,\nbut Ron\u2019s ears went pink again and he muttered that\nhe\u2019d brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the\ncorridor.\n\nHe had never had any money for candy with the\nDursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with\ngold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars\nBars as he could carry \u2014 but the woman didn\u2019t have\nMars Bars. What she did have were Bertie Bott\u2019s\nEvery Flavor Beans, Drooble\u2019s Best Blowing Gum,\nChocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes,\nLicorice Wands, and a number of other strange things\nHarry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss\nanything, he got some of everything and paid the\nwoman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.\n\nRon stared as Harry brought it all back in to the\ncompartment and tipped it onto an empty seat.\n\n\u201cHungry, are you?\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 113 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cStarving,\u201d said Harry, taking a large bite out of a\npumpkin pasty.\n\nRon had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped\nit. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one\nof them apart and said, \u201cShe always forgets I don\u2019t\nlike corned beef.\u201d\n\n\u201cSwap you for one of these,\u201d said Harry, holding up a\npasty. \u201cGo on \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want this, it\u2019s all dry,\u201d said Ron. \u201cShe\nhasn\u2019t got much time,\u201d he added quickly, \u201cyou know,\nwith five of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo on, have a pasty,\u201d said Harry, who had never had\nanything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share\nit with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron,\neating their way through all Harry\u2019s pasties, cakes,\nand candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).\n\n\u201cWhat are these?\u201d Harry asked Ron, holding up a\npack of Chocolate Frogs. \u201cThey\u2019re not really frogs, are\nthey?\u201d He was starting to feel that nothing would\nsurprise him.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ron. \u201cBut see what the card is. I\u2019m missing\nAgrippa.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, of course, you wouldn\u2019t know \u2014 Chocolate Frogs\nhave cards inside them, you know, to collect \u2014\nfamous witches and wizards. I\u2019ve got about five\nhundred, but I haven\u2019t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.\u201d\n\nHarry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up\nthe card. It showed a man\u2019s face. He wore half-moon\nglasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver\n\nPage | 114 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nhair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture\nwas the name Albus Dumbledore.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo this is Dumbledore!\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019d never heard of Dumbledore!\u201d said\nRon. \u201cCan I have a frog? I might get Agrippa \u2014 thanks\n\n\n\nHarry turned over his card and read:\n\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE\n\nCURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS\n\nConsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern\ntimes, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his\ndefeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the\ndiscovery of the twelve uses of dragon\u2019s blood, and his\nwork on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel.\nProfessor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and ten\npin bowling.\n\nHarry turned the card back over and saw, to his\nastonishment, that Dumbledore \u2019s face had\ndisappeared.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you can\u2019t expect him to hang around all day,\u201d\nsaid Ron. \u201cHe\u2019ll be back. No, I\u2019ve got Morgana again\nand I\u2019ve got about six of her ... do you want it? You\ncan start collecting.\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs\nwaiting to be unwrapped.\n\n\u201cHelp yourself,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBut in, you know, the\nMuggle world, people just stay put in photos.\u201d\n\nPage | 115 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDo they? What, they don\u2019t move at all?\u201d Ron sounded\namazed. \u201cWeird).\u201d\n\n\n\nHarry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the\npicture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron\nwas more interested in eating the frogs than looking\nat the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry\ncouldn\u2019t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only\nDumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcraft,\nAlberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He\nfinally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna,\nwho was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie\nBott\u2019s Every Flavor Beans.\n\n\u201cYou want to be careful with those,\u201d Ron warned\nHarry. \u201cWhen they say every flavor, they mean every\nflavor \u2014 you know, you get all the ordinary ones like\nchocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then\nyou can get spinach and liver and tripe. George\nreckons he had a booger-flavored one once.\u201d\n\nRon picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully,\nand bit into a corner.\n\n\u201cBleaaargh \u2014 see? Sprouts.\u201d\n\nThey had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans.\nHarry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry,\ncurry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave\nenough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron\nwouldn\u2019t touch, which turned out to be pepper.\n\nThe countryside now flying past the window was\nbecoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there\nwere woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills.\n\nThere was a knock on the door of their compartment\nand the round-faced boy Harry had passed on\n\nPage | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nplatform nine and three-quarters came in. He looked\ntearful.\n\n\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, \u201cbut have you seen a toad at all?\u201d\n\nWhen they shook their heads, he wailed, \u201cI\u2019ve lost\nhim! He keeps getting away from me!\u201d\n\n\u201cHell turn up,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the boy miserably. \u201cWell, if you see him ...\u201d\nHe left.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know why he\u2019s so bothered,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIf I\u2019d\nbrought a toad I\u2019d lose it as quick as I could. Mind\nyou, I brought Scabbers, so I can\u2019t talk.\u201d\n\nThe rat was still snoozing on Ron\u2019s lap.\n\n\u201cHe might have died and you wouldn\u2019t know the\ndifference,\u201d said Ron in disgust. \u201cI tried to turn him\nyellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but\nthe spell didn\u2019t work. I\u2019ll show you, look ...\u201d\n\nHe rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a\nvery battered-looking wand. It was chipped in places\nand something white was glinting at the end.\n\n\u201cUnicorn hair\u2019s nearly poking out. Anyway \u2014 \u201d\n\nHe had just raised his wand when the compartment\ndoor slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but\nthis time he had a girl with him. She was already\nwearing her new Hogwarts robes.\n\n\u201cHas anyone seen a toad? Neville\u2019s lost one,\u201d she said.\nShe had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown\nhair, and rather large front teeth.\n\nPage | 117 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already told him we haven\u2019t seen it,\u201d said Ron,\nbut the girl wasn\u2019t listening, she was looking at the\nwand in his hand.\n\n\u201cOh, are you doing magic? Let\u2019s see it, then.\u201d\n\nShe sat down. Ron looked taken aback.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 all right.\u201d\n\nHe cleared his throat.\n\n\u201c Sunshine , daisies, butter mellow,\n\nTurn this stupid, fat rat yellow.\u201d\n\nHe waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers\nstayed gray and fast asleep.\n\n\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s a real spell?\u201d said the girl. \u201cWell,\nit\u2019s not very good, is it? I\u2019ve tried a few simple spells\njust for practice and it\u2019s all worked for me. Nobody in\nmy family\u2019s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise\nwhen I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of\ncourse, I mean, it\u2019s the very best school of witchcraft\nthere is, I\u2019ve heard \u2014 I\u2019ve learned all our course books\nby heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough \u2014 I\u2019m\nHermione Granger, by the way, who are you?\u201d\n\nShe said all this very fast.\n\nHarry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his\nstunned face that he hadn\u2019t learned all the course\nbooks by heart either.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Ron Weasley,\u201d Ron muttered.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\n\nPage | 118 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAre you really?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI know all about\nyou, of course \u2014 I got a few extra books for\nbackground reading, and you\u2019re in Modern Magical\nHistory and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and\nGreat Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I?\u201d said Harry, feeling dazed.\n\n\u201cGoodness, didn\u2019t you know, I\u2019d have found out\neverything I could if it was me,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cDo\neither of you know what House you\u2019ll be in? I\u2019ve been\nasking around, and I hope I\u2019m in Gryffindor, it sounds\nby far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it,\nbut I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn\u2019t be too bad. ...\nAnyway, we\u2019d better go and look for Neville\u2019s toad.\n\nYou two had better change, you know, I expect we\u2019ll\nbe there soon.\u201d\n\nAnd she left, taking the toadless boy with her.\n\n\u201cWhatever House I\u2019m in, I hope she\u2019s not in it,\u201d said\nRon. He threw his wand back into his trunk. \u201cStupid\nspell \u2014 George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a\ndud.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat House are your brothers in?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cGryffindor,\u201d said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling\non him again. \u201cMom and Dad were in it, too. I don\u2019t\nknow what they\u2019ll say if I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t suppose\nRavenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put\nme in Slytherin.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was\nin?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron. He flopped back into his seat,\nlooking depressed.\n\n\n\nPage | 119 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou know, I think the ends of Scabbers\u2019 whiskers are\na bit lighter,\u201d said Harry, trying to take Ron\u2019s mind off\nHouses. \u201cSo what do your oldest brothers do now that\nthey\u2019ve left, anyway?\u201d\n\nHarry was wondering what a wizard did once he\u2019d\nfinished school.\n\n\u201cCharlie\u2019s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill\u2019s in\nAfrica doing something for Gringotts,\u201d said Ron. \u201cDid\nyou hear about Gringotts? It\u2019s been all over the Daily\nProphet, but I don\u2019t suppose you get that with the\nMuggles \u2014 someone tried to rob a high security\nvault.\u201d\n\nHarry stared.\n\n\u201cReally? What happened to them?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing, that\u2019s why it\u2019s such big news. They haven\u2019t\nbeen caught. My dad says it must\u2019ve been a powerful\nDark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don\u2019t\nthink they took anything, that\u2019s what\u2019s odd. \u2019Course,\neveryone gets scared when something like this\nhappens in case You-Know-Who\u2019s behind it.\u201d\n\nHarry turned this news over in his mind. He was\nstarting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know-\nWho was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of\nentering the magical world, but it had been a lot more\ncomfortable saying \u201cVoldemort\u201d without worrying.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your Quidditch team?\u201d Ron asked.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 I don\u2019t know any,\u201d Harry confessed.\n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d Ron looked dumbfounded. \u201cOh, you wait, it\u2019s\nthe best game in the world \u2014 \u201d And he was off,\nexplaining all about the four balls and the positions of\n\nPage | 120 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nthe seven players, describing famous games he\u2019d been\nto with his brothers and the broomstick he\u2019d like to\nget if he had the money. He was just taking Harry\nthrough the finer points of the game when the\ncompartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn\u2019t\nNeville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this\ntime.\n\nThree boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle\none at once: It was the pale boy from Madam Malkin\u2019s\nrobe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more\ninterest than he\u2019d shown back in Diagon Alley.\n\n\u201cIs it true?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re saying all down the train\nthat Harry Potter\u2019s in this compartment. So it\u2019s you, is\nit?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. He was looking at the other boys.\nBoth of them were thickset and looked extremely\nmean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they\nlooked like bodyguards.\n\n\u201cOh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\u201d said the pale\nboy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking.\n\n\u201cAnd my names Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.\u201d\n\nRon gave a slight cough, which might have been\nhiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at him.\n\n\u201cThink my name\u2019s funny, do you? No need to ask who\nyou are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red\nhair, freckles, and more children than they can\nafford.\u201d\n\nHe turned back to Harry. \u201cYou\u2019ll soon find out some\nwizarding families are much better than others,\n\nPotter. You don\u2019t want to go making friends with the\nwrong sort. I can help you there.\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 121 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nHe held out his hand to shake Harry\u2019s, but Harry\ndidn\u2019t take it.\n\n\u201cI think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself,\nthanks,\u201d he said coolly.\n\nDraco Malfoy didn\u2019t go red, but a pink tinge appeared\nin his pale cheeks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be careful if I were you, Potter,\u201d he said slowly.\n\u201cUnless you\u2019re a bit politer you\u2019ll go the same way as\nyour parents. They didn\u2019t know what was good for\nthem, either. You hang around with riffraff like the\nWeasleys and that Hagrid, and it\u2019ll rub off on you.\u201d\n\nBoth Harry and Ron stood up.\n\n\u201cSay that again,\u201d Ron said, his face as red as his hair.\n\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re going to fight us, are you?\u201d Malfoy\nsneered.\n\n\u201cUnless you get out now,\u201d said Harry, more bravely\nthan he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot\nbigger than him or Ron.\n\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t feel like leaving, do we, boys? We\u2019ve\neaten all our food and you still seem to have some.\u201d\n\nGoyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to\nRon \u2014 Ron leapt forward, but before he\u2019d so much as\ntouched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.\n\nScabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp\nlittle teeth sunk deep into Goyle \u2019s knuckle \u2014 Crabbe\nand Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers\nround and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally\nflew off and hit the window, all three of them\ndisappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were\nPage | 122 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nmore rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps\nthey\u2019d heard footsteps, because a second later,\nHermione Granger had come in.\n\n\u201cWhat has been going on?\u201d she said, looking at the\nsweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers\nby his tail.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s been knocked out,\u201d Ron said to Harry.\n\nHe looked closer at Scabbers. \u201cNo \u2014 I don\u2019t believe it\n\u2014 he\u2019s gone back to sleep.\u201d\n\nAnd so he had.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve met Malfoy before?\u201d\n\nHarry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of his family,\u201d said Ron darkly. \u201cThey were\nsome of the first to come back to our side after You-\nKnow-Who disappeared. Said they\u2019d been bewitched.\nMy dad doesn\u2019t believe it. He says Malfoy\u2019s father\ndidn\u2019t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.\u201d He\nturned to Hermione. \u201cCan we help you with\nsomething?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better hurry up and put your robes on, I\u2019ve\njust been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he\nsays we\u2019re nearly there. You haven\u2019t been fighting,\nhave you? You\u2019ll be in trouble before we even get\nthere!\u201d\n\n\u201cScabbers has been fighting, not us,\u201d said Ron,\nscowling at her. \u201cWould you mind leaving while we\nchange?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right \u2014 I only came in here because people\noutside are behaving very childishly, racing up and\ndown the corridors,\u201d said Hermione in a sniffy voice.\n\nPage | 123 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you\nknow?\u201d\n\n\n\nRon glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the\nwindow. It was getting dark. He could see mountains\nand forests under a deep purple sky. The train did\nseem to be slowing down.\n\nHe and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their\nlong black robes. Ron\u2019s were a bit short for him, you\ncould see his sneakers underneath them.\n\nA voice echoed through the train: \u201cWe will be reaching\nHogwarts in five minutes\u2019 time. Please leave your\nluggage on the train, it will be taken to the school\nseparately.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he\nsaw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed\ntheir pockets with the last of the sweets and joined\nthe crowd thronging the corridor.\n\nThe train slowed right down and finally stopped.\nPeople pushed their way toward the door and out on\nto a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold\nnight air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads\nof the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice:\n\u201cFirs\u2019 years! Firs\u2019 years over here! All right there,\nHarry?\u201d\n\nHagrid\u2019s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, follow me \u2014 any more firs\u2019 years? Mind yer\nstep, now! Firs\u2019 years follow me!\u201d\n\nSlipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down\nwhat seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so\ndark on either side of them that Harry thought there\nmust be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much.\n\nPage | 124 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nNeville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once\nor twice.\n\n\n\n\u201cYeh\u2019ll get yer firs\u2019 sight o\u2019 Hogwarts in a sec,\u201d Hagrid\ncalled over his shoulder, \u201cjus\u2019 round this bend here.\u201d\n\nThere was a loud \u201cOooooh!\u201d\n\nThe narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge\nof a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain\non the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry\nsky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.\n\n\u201cNo more\u2019n four to a boat!\u201d Hagrid called, pointing to\na fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore.\nHarry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville\nand Hermione.\n\n\u201cEveryone in?\u201d shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to\nhimself. \u201cRight then \u2014 FORWARD!\u201d\n\nAnd the fleet of little boats moved off all at once,\ngliding across the lake, which was as smooth as\nglass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great\ncastle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed\nnearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.\n\n\u201cHeads down!\u201d yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached\nthe cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats\ncarried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide\nopening in the cliff face. They were carried along a\ndark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right\nunderneath the castle, until they reached a kind of\nunderground harbor, where they clambered out onto\nrocks and pebbles.\n\n\u201cOy, you there! Is this your toad?\u201d said Hagrid, who\nwas checking the boats as people climbed out of\nthem.\n\nPage | 125 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTrevor!\u201d cried Neville blissfully, holding out his\nhands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the\nrock after Hagrid\u2019s lamp, coming out at last onto\nsmooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.\n\nThey walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded\naround the huge, oak front door.\n\n\u201cEveryone here? You there, still got yer toad?\u201d\n\nHagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times\non the castle door.\n\n\n\nPage | 126 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\nTHE SORTING HAT\n\nThe door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired\nwitch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a\nvery stern face and Harry\u2019s first thought was that this\nwas not someone to cross.\n\n\u201cThe firs\u2019 years, Professor McGonagall,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cThank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.\u201d\n\nShe pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so\nbig you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys\u2019\nhouse in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming\ntorches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too\nhigh to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase\nfacing them led to the upper floors.\n\nThey followed Professor McGonagall across the\nflagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of\nhundreds of voices from a doorway to the right \u2014 the\nrest of the school must already be here \u2014 but\nProfessor McGonagall showed the first years into a\nsmall, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,\nPage | 127 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\nstanding rather closer together than they would\nusually have done, peering about nervously.\n\n\u201cWelcome to Hogwarts,\u201d said Professor McGonagall.\n\u201cThe start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but\nbefore you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will\nbe sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very\nimportant ceremony because, while you are here,\nyour House will be something like your family within\nHogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your\nHouse, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free\ntime in your House common room.\n\n\u201cThe four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff,\nRavenclaw, and Slytherin. Each House has its own\nnoble history and each has produced outstanding\nwitches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your\ntriumphs will earn your House points, while any rule-\nbreaking will lose House points. At the end of the\nyear, the House with the most points is awarded the\nHouse cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a\ncredit to whichever House becomes yours.\n\n\u201cThe Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few\nminutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest\nyou all smarten yourselves up as much as you can\nwhile you are waiting.\u201d\n\nHer eyes lingered for a moment on Neville\u2019s cloak,\nwhich was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron\u2019s\nsmudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his\nhair.\n\n\u201cI shall return when we are ready for you,\u201d said\nProfessor McGonagall. \u201cPlease wait quietly.\u201d\n\nShe left the chamber. Harry swallowed.\n\n\n\nPage | 128 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHow exactly do they sort us into Houses?\u201d he asked\nRon.\n\n\n\n\u201cSome sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but\nI think he was joking.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of\nthe whole school? But he didn\u2019t know any magic yet\n\u2014 what on earth would he have to do? He hadn\u2019t\nexpected something like this the moment they\narrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that\neveryone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking\nmuch except Hermione Granger, who was whispering\nvery fast about all the spells she\u2019d learned and\nwondering which one she\u2019d need. Harry tried hard not\nto listen to her. He\u2019d never been more nervous, never,\nnot even when he\u2019d had to take a school report home\nto the Dursleys saying that he\u2019d somehow turned his\nteachers wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door.\nAny second now, Professor McGonagall would come\nback and lead him to his doom.\n\nThen something happened that made him jump about\na foot in the air \u2014 several people behind him\nscreamed.\n\n\u201cWhat the \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nHe gasped. So did the people around him. About\ntwenty ghosts had just streamed through the back\nwall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they\nglided across the room talking to one another and\nhardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be\narguing. What looked like a fat little monk was\nsaying: \u201cForgive and forget, I say, we ought to give\nhim a second chance \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Friar, haven\u2019t we given Peeves all the\nchances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and\n\nPage | 129 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nyou know, he\u2019s not really even a ghost \u2014 I say, what\nare you all doing here?\u201d\n\n\n\nA ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly\nnoticed the first years.\n\nNobody answered.\n\n\u201cNew students!\u201d said the Fat Friar, smiling around at\nthem. \u201cAbout to be Sorted, I suppose?\u201d\n\nA few people nodded mutely.\n\n\u201cHope to see you in Hufflepuff!\u201d said the Friar. \u201cMy old\nHouse, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cMove along now,\u201d said a sharp voice. \u201cThe Sorting\nCeremony\u2019s about to start.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the\nghosts floated away through the opposite wall.\n\n\u201cNow, form a line,\u201d Professor McGonagall told the first\nyears, \u201cand follow me.\u201d\n\nFeeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead,\nHarry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with\nRon behind him, and they walked out of the chamber,\nback across the hall, and through a pair of double\ndoors into the Great Hall.\n\nHarry had never even imagined such a strange and\nsplendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands\nof candles that were floating in midair over four long\ntables, where the rest of the students were sitting.\nThese tables were laid with glittering golden plates\nand goblets. At the top of the hall was another long\ntable where the teachers were sitting. Professor\nMcGonagall led the first years up here, so that they\nPage | 130 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\ncame to a halt in a line facing the other students,\nwith the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces\nstaring at them looked like pale lanterns in the\nflickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among\nthe students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to\navoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and\nsaw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard\nHermione whisper, \u201cIt\u2019s bewitched to look like the sky\noutside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.\u201d\n\nIt was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all,\nand that the Great Hall didn\u2019t simply open on to the\nheavens.\n\nHarry quickly looked down again as Professor\nMcGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front\nof the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed\nwizard\u2019s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and\nextremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn\u2019t have let it in\nthe house.\n\nMaybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry\nthought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing \u2014\nnoticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at\nthe hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there\nwas complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip\nnear the brim opened wide like a mouth \u2014 and the\nhat began to sing:\n\n\u201cOh, you may not think I\u2019m pretty,\n\nBut don\u2019t judge on what you see,\n\nI\u2019ll eat myself if you can find\n\nA smarter hat than me.\n\nYou can keep your bowlers black,\n\n\n\nPage | 131 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nYour top hats sleek and tall,\n\nFor I\u2019m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat\nAnd I can cap them all.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing hidden in your head\nThe Sorting Hat can\u2019t see,\n\nSo try me on and I will tell you\nWhere you ought to be.\n\nYou might belong in Gryffindor,\n\nWhere dwell the brave at heart,\n\nTheir daring, nerve, and chivalry\nSet Gryffindors apart;\n\nYou might belong in Hufflepuff,\n\nWhere they are just and loyal,\n\nThose patient Hufflepuffs are true\nAnd unafraid of toil;\n\nOr yet in wise old Ravenclaw,\n\nIf you\u2019ve a ready mind,\n\nWhere those of wit and learning,\n\nWill always find their kind;\n\nOr perhaps in Slytherin\n\nPage | 132 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll make your real friends,\n\nThose cunning folk use any means\nTo achieve their ends.\n\nSo put me on! Don\u2019t be afraid l\nAnd don\u2019t get in a flap\nYou\u2019re in safe hands (though I have none)\n\nFor I\u2019m a Thinking Cap\u201d\n\nThe whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished\nits song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then\nbecame quite still again.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ve just got to try on the hat!\u201d Ron whispered to\nHarry. \u201cI\u2019ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling\na troll.\u201d\n\nHarry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot\nbetter than having to do a spell, but he did wish they\ncould have tried it on without everyone watching. The\nhat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn\u2019t feel\nbrave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If\nonly the hat had mentioned a House for people who\nfelt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for\nhim.\n\nProfessor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a\nlong roll of parchment.\n\n\u201cWhen I call your name, you will put on the hat and\nsit on the stool to be sorted,\u201d she said. \u201cAbbott,\nHannah!\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 133 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nA pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of\nline, put on the hat, which fell right down over her\neyes, and sat down. A moment\u2019s pause \u2014\n\n\u201cHUFFLEPUFF!\u201d shouted the hat.\n\nThe table on the right cheered and clapped as\nHannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table.\n\nHarry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at\nher.\n\n\u201cBones, Susan!\u201d\n\n\u201cHUFFLEPUFF!\u201d shouted the hat again, and Susan\nscuttled off to sit next to Hannah.\n\n\u201cBoot, Terry!\u201d\n\n\u201cRAVENCLAW!\u201d\n\nThe table second from the left clapped this time;\nseveral Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with\nTerry as he joined them.\n\n\u201cBrocklehurst, Mandy\u201d went to Ravenclaw too, but\n\u201cBrown, Lavender\u201d became the first new Gryffindor,\nand the table on the far left exploded with cheers;\nHarry could see Ron\u2019s twin brothers catcalling.\n\n\u201cBulstrode, Millicent\u201d then became a Slytherin.\nPerhaps it was Harry\u2019s imagination, after all he\u2019d\nheard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked\nlike an unpleasant lot.\n\nHe was starting to feel definitely sick now. He\nremembered being picked for teams during gym at his\nold school. He had always been last to be chosen, not\nbecause he was no good, but because no one wanted\nDudley to think they liked him.\n\nPage | 134 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFinch-Fletchley, Justin!\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHUFFLEPUFF!\u201d\n\nSometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the\nHouse at once, but at others it took a little while to\ndecide. \u201cFinnigan, Seamus,\u201d the sandy-haired boy\nnext to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a\nwhole minute before the hat declared him a\nGryffindor.\n\n\u201cGranger, Hermione!\u201d\n\nHermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat\neagerly on her head.\n\n\u201cGRYFFINDOR!\u201d shouted the hat. Ron groaned.\n\nA horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts\nalways do when you\u2019re very nervous. What if he\nwasn\u2019t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with\nthe hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor\nMcGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had\nobviously been a mistake and he\u2019d better get back on\nthe train?\n\nWhen Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his\ntoad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool.\nThe hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When\nit finally shouted, \u201cGRYFFINDOR,\u201d Neville ran off still\nwearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter\nto give it to \u201cMacDougal, Morag.\u201d\n\nMalfoy swaggered forward when his name was called\nand got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched\nhis head when it screamed, \u201cSLYTHERIN!\u201d\n\nMalfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle,\nlooking pleased with himself.\n\nPage | 135 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nThere weren\u2019t many people left now.\n\n\n\n\u201cMoon\u201d , \u201cNott\u201d ... , \u201cParkinson\u201d ... , then a pair of\ntwin girls, \u201cPath\u201d and \u201cPath\u201d ... , then \u201cPerks, Sally-\nAnne\u201d . . . , and then, at last \u2014\n\n\u201cPotter, Harry!\u201d\n\nAs Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke\nout like little hissing fires all over the hall.\n\n\u201c Potter , did she say?\u201d\n\n\u201c The Harry Potter?\u201d\n\nThe last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over\nhis eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a\ngood look at him. Next second he was looking at the\nblack inside of the hat. He waited.\n\n\u201cHmm,\u201d said a small voice in his ear. \u201cDifficult. Very\ndifficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind\neither. There\u2019s talent, oh my goodness, yes \u2014 and a\nnice thirst to prove yourself, now that\u2019s interesting. ...\nSo where shall I put you?\u201d\n\nHarry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not\nSlytherin, not Slytherin.\n\n\u201cNot Slytherin, eh?\u201d said the small voice. \u201cAre you\nsure? You could be great, you know, it\u2019s all here in\nyour head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to\ngreatness, no doubt about that \u2014 no? Well, if you\u2019re\nsure \u2014 better be GRYFFINDOR!\u201d\n\nHarry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole\nhall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward\nthe Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been\nchosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed\n\nPage | 136 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nthat he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the\nPrefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while\nthe Weasley twins yelled, \u201cWe got Potter! We got\nPotter!\u201d Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff\nhe\u2019d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving\nHarry the sudden, horrible feeling he\u2019d just plunged it\ninto a bucket of ice-cold water.\n\nHe could see the High Table properly now. At the end\nnearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave\nhim the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there,\nin the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair,\nsat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once\nfrom the card he\u2019d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on\nthe train. Dumbledore\u2019s silver hair was the only thing\nin the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts.\nHarry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous\nyoung man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking\nvery peculiar in a large purple turban.\n\nAnd now there were only four people left to be sorted.\n\u201cThomas, Dean,\u201d a Black boy even taller than Ron,\njoined Harry at the Gryffindor table. \u201cTurpin, Lisa,\u201d\nbecame a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron\u2019s turn. He\nwas pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers\nunder the table and a second later the hat had\nshouted, \u201cGRYFFINDOR!\u201d\n\nHarry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed\ninto the chair next to him.\n\n\u201cWell done, Ron, excellent,\u201d said Percy Weasley\npompously across Harry as \u201cZabini, Blaise,\u201d was\nmade a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her\nscroll and took the Sorting Hat away.\n\nHarry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had\nonly just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin\npasties seemed ages ago.\n\nPage | 137 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nAlbus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was\nbeaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if\nnothing could have pleased him more than to see\nthem all there.\n\n\u201cWelcome!\u201d he said. \u201cWelcome to a new year at\nHogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like\nto say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit!\n\nBlubber! Oddment! Tweak!\n\n\u201cThank you!\u201d\n\nHe sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered.\nHarry didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or not.\n\n\u201cIs he \u2014 a bit mad?\u201d he asked Percy uncertainly.\n\n\u201cMad?\u201d said Percy airily. \u201cHe\u2019s a genius! Best wizard\nin the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes,\nHarry?\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him\nwere now piled with food. He had never seen so many\nthings he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast\nchicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages,\nbacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes,\nfries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy,\nketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint\nhumbugs.\n\nThe Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but\nhe\u2019d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked.\nDudley had always taken anything that Harry really\nwanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate\nwith a bit of everything except the peppermints and\nbegan to eat. It was all delicious.\n\n\u201cThat does look good,\u201d said the ghost in the ruff sadly,\nwatching Harry cut up his steak.\n\nPage | 138 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t you \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t eaten for nearly five hundred years,\u201d said\nthe ghost. \u201cI don\u2019t need to, of course, but one does\nmiss it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve introduced myself? Sir\nNicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service.\nResident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know who you are!\u201d said Ron suddenly. \u201cMy\nbrothers told me about you \u2014 you\u2019re Nearly Headless\nNick!\u201d\n\n\u201cI would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy\n\u2014 \u201d the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus\nFinnigan interrupted.\n\n\u201cNearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?\u201d\n\nSir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little\nchat wasn\u2019t going at all the way he wanted.\n\n\u201cLike this,\u201d he said irritably. He seized his left ear and\npulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell\nonto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone\nhad obviously tried to behead him, but not done it\nproperly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on\ntheir faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head\nback onto his neck, coughed, and said, \u201cSo \u2014 new\nGryffindors! I hope you\u2019re going to help us win the\nHouse Championship this year? Gryffindors have\nnever gone so long without winning. Slytherins have\ngot the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron\u2019s\nbecoming almost unbearable \u2014 he\u2019s the Slytherin\nghost.\u201d\n\nHarry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a\nhorrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a\ngaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He\nwas right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to\n\nPage | 139 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nsee, didn\u2019t look too pleased with the seating\narrangements.\n\n\u201cHow did he get covered in blood?\u201d asked Seamus\nwith great interest.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never asked,\u201d said Nearly Headless Nick\ndelicately.\n\nWhen everyone had eaten as much as they could, the\nremains of the food faded from the plates, leaving\nthem sparkling clean as before. A moment later the\ndesserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor\nyou could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate\neclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-\n0, rice pudding ...\n\nAs Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk\nturned to their families.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m half-and-half,\u201d said Seamus. \u201cMe dad\u2019s a Muggle.\nMom didn\u2019t tell him she was a witch \u2019til after they\nwere married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.\u201d\n\nThe others laughed.\n\n\u201cWhat about you, Neville?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWell, my gran brought me up and she\u2019s a witch,\u201d\nsaid Neville, \u201cbut the family thought I was all- Muggle\nfor ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me\noff my guard and force some magic out of me \u2014 he\npushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly\ndrowned \u2014 but nothing happened until I was eight.\nGreat Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was\nhanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles\nwhen my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue\nand he accidentally let go. But I bounced \u2014 all the\nway down the garden and into the road. They were all\nPage | 140 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nreally pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy.\nAnd you should have seen their faces when I got in\nhere \u2014 they thought I might not be magic enough to\ncome, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he\nbought me my toad.\u201d\n\nOn Harry\u2019s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione\nwere talking about lessons (\u201cI do hope they start right\naway, there\u2019s so much to learn, I\u2019m particularly\ninterested in Transfiguration, you know, turning\nsomething into something else, of course, it\u2019s\nsupposed to be very difficult \u2014 \u201cYou\u2019ll be starting\nsmall, just matches into needles and that sort of\nthing \u2014 \u201d).\n\n\n\nHarry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy,\nlooked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was\ndrinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall\nwas talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor\nQuirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a\nteacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and\nsallow skin.\n\nIt happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher\nlooked past Quirrell\u2019s turban straight into Harry\u2019s\neyes \u2014 and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on\nHarry\u2019s forehead.\n\n\u201cOuch!\u201d Harry clapped a hand to his head.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Percy.\n\n\u201cN-nothing.\u201d\n\nThe pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder\nto shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the\nteacher\u2019s look \u2014 a feeling that he didn\u2019t like Harry at\nall.\n\n\n\nPage | 141 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\u201d he\nasked Percy.\n\n\u201cOh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder\nhe\u2019s looking so nervous, that\u2019s Professor Snape. He\nteaches Potions, but he doesn\u2019t want to \u2014 everyone\nknows he\u2019s after Quirrell\u2019s job. Knows an awful lot\nabout the Dark Arts, Snape.\u201d\n\nHarry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn\u2019t\nlook at him again.\n\nAt last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor\nDumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.\n\n\u201cAhem \u2014 just a few more words now that we are all\nfed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to\ngive you.\n\n\u201cFirst years should note that the forest on the\ngrounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our\nolder students would do well to remember that as\nwell.\u201d\n\nDumbledore \u2019s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction\nof the Weasley twins.\n\n\u201cI have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to\nremind you all that no magic should be used between\nclasses in the corridors.\n\n\u201cQuidditch trials will be held in the second week of\nthe term. Anyone interested in playing for their House\nteams should contact Madam Hooch.\n\n\u201cAnd finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-\nfloor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds\nto everyone who does not wish to die a very painful\ndeath.\u201d\n\nPage | 142 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nHarry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not serious?\u201d he muttered to Percy.\n\n\u201cMust be,\u201d said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. \u201cIt\u2019s\nodd, because he usually gives us a reason why we\u2019re\nnot allowed to go somewhere \u2014 the forest\u2019s full of\ndangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he\nmight have told us prefects, at least.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school\nsong!\u201d cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other\nteachers\u2019 smiles had become rather fixed.\n\nDumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was\ntrying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden\nribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables\nand twisted itself, snakelike, into words.\n\n\u201cEveryone pick their favorite tune,\u201d said Dumbledore,\n\u201cand off we go!\u201d\n\nAnd the school bellowed:\n\n\u201cHogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,\n\nTeach us something please,\n\nWhether we be old and bald\nOr young with scabby knees,\n\nOur heads could do with filling\nWith some interesting stuff,\n\nFor now they\u2019re bare and full of air,\n\nDead flies and bits of fluff,\n\nPage | 143 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nSo teach us things worth knowing,\n\nBring back what we\u2019ve forgot,\n\nJust do your best, we\u2019ll do the rest,\n\nAnd learn until our brains all rot.\u201d\n\nEverybody finished the song at different times. At last,\nonly the Weasley twins were left singing along to a\nvery slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their\nlast few lines with his wand and when they had\nfinished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.\n\n\u201cAh, music,\u201d he said, wiping his eyes. \u201cA magic\nbeyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you\ntrot!\u201d\n\nThe Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the\nchattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the\nmarble staircase. Harry\u2019s legs were like lead again,\nbut only because he was so tired and full of food. He\nwas too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in\nthe portraits along the corridors whispered and\npointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them\nthrough doorways hidden behind sliding panels and\nhanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases,\nyawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just\nwondering how much farther they had to go when\nthey came to a sudden halt.\n\nA bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair\nahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them\nthey started throwing themselves at him.\n\n\u201cPeeves,\u201d Percy whispered to the first years. \u201cA\npoltergeist.\u201d He raised his voice, \u201cPeeves \u2014 show\nyourself.\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 144 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nA loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a\nballoon, answered.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?\u201d\n\nThere was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark\neyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-\nlegged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.\n\n\u201cOooooooh!\u201d he said, with an evil cackle. \u201cIckle\nFirsties! What fun!\u201d\n\nHe swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.\n\n\u201cGo away, Peeves, or the Baron\u2019ll hear about this, I\nmean it!\u201d barked Percy.\n\nPeeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping\nthe walking sticks on Neville\u2019s head. They heard him\nzooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.\n\n\u201cYou want to watch out for Peeves,\u201d said Percy, as\nthey set off again. \u201cThe Bloody Baron\u2019s the only one\nwho can control him, he won\u2019t even listen to us\nprefects. Here we are.\u201d\n\nAt the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a\nvery fat woman in a pink silk dress.\n\n\u201cPassword?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cCaput Draconis,\u201d said Percy, and the portrait swung\nforward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all\nscrambled through it \u2014 Neville needed a leg up \u2014\nand found themselves in the Gryffindor common\nroom, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.\n\nPercy directed the girls through one door to their\ndormitory and the boys through another. At the top of\n\nPage | 145 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\na spiral staircase \u2014 they were obviously in one of the\ntowers \u2014 they found their beds at last: five four-\nposters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their\ntrunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk\nmuch, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.\n\n\u201cGreat food, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ron muttered to Harry through\nthe hangings. \u201cGet off Scabbers! He\u2019s chewing my\nsheets.\u201d\n\nHarry was going to ask Ron if he\u2019d had any of the\ntreacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.\n\nPerhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he\nhad a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor\nQuirrell\u2019s turban, which kept talking to him, telling\nhim he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it\nwas his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn\u2019t want\nto be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried\nto pull it off but it tightened painfully \u2014 and there\nwas Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it \u2014\nthen Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher,\nSnape, whose laugh became high and cold \u2014 there\nwas a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating\nand shaking.\n\nHe rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he\nwoke next day, he didn\u2019t remember the dream at all.\n\n\n\nPage | 146 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE POTIONS MASTER\n\n\u201cThere, look.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cNext to the tall kid with the red hair.\u201d\n\n\u201cWearing the glasses?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you see his face?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you see his scar?\u201d\n\nWhispers followed Harry from the moment he left his\ndormitory the next day. People lining up outside\nclassrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or\ndoubled back to pass him in the corridors again,\nstaring. Harry wished they wouldn\u2019t, because he was\ntrying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.\n\nThere were a hundred and forty-two staircases at\nHogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones;\nsome that led somewhere different on a Friday; some\n\nPage | 147 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\nwith a vanishing step halfway up that you had to\nremember to jump. Then there were doors that\nwouldn\u2019t open unless you asked politely, or tickled\nthem in exactly the right place, and doors that weren\u2019t\nreally doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It\nwas also very hard to remember where anything was,\nbecause it all seemed to move around a lot. The\npeople in the portraits kept going to visit each other,\nand Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.\n\nThe ghosts didn\u2019t help, either. It was always a nasty\nshock when one of them glided suddenly through a\ndoor you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick\nwas always happy to point new Gryffindors in the\nright direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth\ntwo locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him\nwhen you were late for class. He would drop\nwastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from\nunder your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak\nup behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech,\n\u201cGOT YOUR CONK!\u201d\n\nEven worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the\ncaretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get\non the wrong side of him on their very first morning.\nFilch found them trying to force their way through a\ndoor that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to\nthe out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He\nwouldn\u2019t believe they were lost, was sure they were\ntrying to break into it on purpose, and was\nthreatening to lock them in the dungeons when they\nwere rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.\n\nFilch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-\ncolored creature with bulging, lamplike eyes just like\nFilch\u2019s. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule\nin front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she\u2019d\nwhisk off for Filch, who\u2019d appear, wheezing, two\nseconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of\nPage | 148 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nthe school better than anyone (except perhaps the\nWeasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any\nof the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was\nthe dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a\ngood kick.\n\nAnd then, once you had managed to find them, there\nwere the classes themselves. There was a lot more to\nmagic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your\nwand and saying a few funny words.\n\nThey had to study the night skies through their\ntelescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn\nthe names of different stars and the movements of the\nplanets. Three times a week they went out to the\ngreenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology,\nwith a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout,\nwhere they learned how to take care of all the strange\nplants and fungi, and found out what they were used\nfor.\n\nEasily the most boring class was History of Magic,\nwhich was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor\nBinns had been very old indeed when he had fallen\nasleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next\nmorning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns\ndroned on and on while they scribbled down names\nand dates, and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the\nOddball mixed up.\n\nProfessor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny\nlittle wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to\nsee over his desk. At the start of their first class he\ntook the roll call, and when he reached Harry\u2019s name\nhe gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.\n\nProfessor McGonagall was again different. Harry had\nbeen quite right to think she wasn\u2019t a teacher to\n\n\n\nPage | 149 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\ncross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking- to\nthe moment they sat down in her first class.\n\n\u201cTransfiguration is some of the most complex and\ndangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cAnyone messing around in my class will leave\nand not come back. You have been warned.\u201d\n\nThen she changed her desk into a pig and back again.\nThey were all very impressed and couldn\u2019t wait to get\nstarted, but soon realized they weren\u2019t going to be\nchanging the furniture into animals for a long time.\nAfter taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each\ngiven a match and started trying to turn it into a\nneedle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione\nGranger had made any difference to her match;\nProfessor McGonagall showed the class how it had\ngone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare\nsmile.\n\nThe class everyone had really been looking forward to\nwas Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell\u2019s\nlessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom\nsmelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to\nward off a vampire he\u2019d met in Romania and was\nafraid would be coming back to get him one of these\ndays. His turban, he told them, had been given to him\nby an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of\na troublesome zombie, but they weren\u2019t sure they\nbelieved this story. For one thing, when Seamus\nFinnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had\nfought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started\ntalking about the weather; for another, they had\nnoticed that a funny smell hung around the turban,\nand the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full\nof garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected\nwherever he went.\n\n\n\nPage | 150 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nHarry was very relieved to find out that he wasn\u2019t\nmiles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come\nfrom Muggle families and, like him, hadn\u2019t had any\nidea that they were witches and wizards. There was so\nmuch to learn that even people like Ron didn\u2019t have\nmuch of a head start.\n\nFriday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They\nfinally managed to find their way down to the Great\nHall for breakfast without getting lost once.\n\n\u201cWhat have we got today?\u201d Harry asked Ron as he\npoured sugar on his porridge.\n\n\u201cDouble Potions with the Slytherins,\u201d said Ron.\n\u201cSnape\u2019s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always\nfavors them \u2014 we\u2019ll be able to see if it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\n\u201cWish McGonagall favored us,\u201d said Harry. Professor\nMcGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it\nhadn\u2019t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of\nhomework the day before.\n\nJust then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to\nthis by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on\nthe first morning, when about a hundred owls had\nsuddenly streamed into the Great Hall during\nbreakfast, circling the tables until they saw their\nowners, and dropping letters and packages onto their\nlaps.\n\nHedwig hadn\u2019t brought Harry anything so far. She\nsometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of\ntoast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the\nother school owls. This morning, however, she\nfluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar\nbowl and dropped a note onto Harry\u2019s plate. Harry\ntore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:\n\n\n\nPage | 151 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nDear Harry,\n\n\n\nI know you get Friday afternoons off so would you like\nto come and have a cup of tea with me around three?\n\nI want to hear all about your first week. Send us an\nanswer back with Hedwig.\n\nHagrid\n\nHarry borrowed Ron\u2019s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see\nyou later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off\nagain.\n\nIt was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look\nforward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to\nbe the worst thing that had happened to him so far.\n\nAt the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the\nidea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of\nthe first Potions lesson, he knew he\u2019d been wrong.\nSnape didn\u2019t dislike Harry \u2014 he hated him.\n\nPotions lessons took place down in one of the\ndungeons. It was colder here than up in the main\ncastle, and would have been quite creepy enough\nwithout the pickled animals floating in glass jars all\naround the walls.\n\nSnape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the\nroll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cAh, yes,\u201d he said softly, \u201cHarry Potter. Our new \u2014\ncelebrity.\u201d\n\nDraco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle\nsniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling\nthe names and looked up at the class. His eyes were\nblack like Hagrid \u2019s, but they had none of Hagrid \u2019s\n\nPage | 152 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nwarmth. They were cold and empty and made you\nthink of dark tunnels.\n\n\u201cYou are here to learn the subtle science and exact art\nof potion-making,\u201d he began. He spoke in barely more\nthan a whisper, but they caught every word \u2014 like\nProfessor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a\nclass silent without effort. \u201cAs there is little foolish\nwand- waving here, many of you will hardly believe\nthis is magic. I don\u2019t expect you will really understand\nthe beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its\nshimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that\ncreep through human veins, bewitching the mind,\nensnaring the senses. ... I can teach you how to bottle\nfame, brew glory, even stopper death \u2014 if you aren\u2019t\nas big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to\nteach.\u201d\n\nMore silence followed this little speech. Harry and\nRon exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione\nGranger was on the edge of her seat and looked\ndesperate to start proving that she wasn\u2019t a\ndunderhead.\n\n\u201cPotter!\u201d said Snape suddenly. \u201cWhat would I get if I\nadded powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of\nwormwood?\u201d\n\nPowdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry\nglanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was;\nHermione \u2019s hand had shot into the air.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, sir,\u201d said Harry.\n\nSnape \u2019s lips curled into a sneer.\n\n\u201cTut, tut \u2014 fame clearly isn\u2019t everything.\u201d\n\nHe ignored Hermione \u2019s hand.\n\nPage | 153 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told\nyou to find me a bezoar?\u201d\n\nHermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it\nwould go without her leaving her seat, but Harry\ndidn\u2019t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He\ntried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who\nwere shaking with laughter.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cThought you wouldn\u2019t open a book before coming,\neh, Potter?\u201d\n\nHarry forced himself to keep looking straight into\nthose cold eyes. He had looked through his books at\nthe Dursleys\u2019, but did Snape expect him to remember\neverything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and\nFungi ?\n\nSnape was still ignoring Hermione\u2019s quivering hand.\n\n\u201cWhat is the difference, Potter, between monkshood\nand wolfsbane?\u201d\n\nAt this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching\ntoward the dungeon ceiling.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Harry quietly. \u201cI think Hermione\ndoes, though, why don\u2019t you try her?\u201d\n\nA few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus\u2019s eye,\nand Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not\npleased.\n\n\u201cSit down,\u201d he snapped at Hermione. \u201cFor your\ninformation, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a\nsleeping potion so powerful it is known as the\nDraught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken\n\nPage | 154 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nfrom the stomach of a goat and it will save you from\nmost poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they\nare the same plant, which also goes by the name of\naconite. Well? Why aren\u2019t you all copying that down?\u201d\n\nThere was a sudden rummaging for quills and\nparchment. Over the noise, Snape said, \u201cAnd a point\nwill be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek,\nPotter.\u201d\n\nThings didn\u2019t improve for the Gryffindors as the\nPotions lesson continued. Snape put them all into\npairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to\ncure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak,\nwatching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake\nfangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy,\nwhom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone\nto look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his\nhorned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a\nloud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow\nmanaged to melt Seamus\u2019s cauldron into a twisted\nblob, and their potion was seeping across the stone\nfloor, burning holes in people\u2019s shoes. Within\nseconds, the whole class was standing on their stools\nwhile Neville, who had been drenched in the potion\nwhen the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as\nangry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.\n\n\u201cIdiot boy!\u201d snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion\naway with one wave of his wand. \u201cI suppose you\nadded the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron\noff the fire?\u201d\n\nNeville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over\nhis nose.\n\n\u201cTake him up to the hospital wing,\u201d Snape spat at\nSeamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who\nhad been working next to Neville.\n\nPage | 155 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou \u2014 Potter \u2014 why didn\u2019t you tell him not to add\nthe quills? Thought he\u2019d make you look good if he got\nit wrong, did you? That\u2019s another point you\u2019ve lost for\nGryffindor.\u201d\n\nThis was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to\nargue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t push it,\u201d he muttered, \u201cI\u2019ve heard Snape can\nturn very nasty.\u201d\n\nAs they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour\nlater, Harry\u2019s mind was racing and his spirits were\nlow. He\u2019d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very\nfirst week \u2014 why did Snape hate him so much?\n\n\u201cCheer up,\u201d said Ron, \u201cSnape\u2019s always taking points\noff Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid\nwith you?\u201d\n\nAt five to three they left the castle and made their way\nacross the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden\nhouse on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow\nand a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.\n\nWhen Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling\nfrom inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid \u2019s\nvoice rang out, saying, \u201cBack, Fang \u2014 back.\u201d\n\nHagrid \u2019s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he\npulled the door open.\n\n\u201cHang on,\u201d he said. \u201cBack, Fang.\u201d\n\nHe let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar\nof an enormous black boarhound.\n\nThere was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants\nwere hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was\n\nPage | 156 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nboiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a\nmassive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.\n\n\u201cMake yerselves at home,\u201d said Hagrid, letting go of\nFang, who bounded straight at Ron and started\nlicking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as\nfierce as he looked.\n\n\u201cThis is Ron,\u201d Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring\nboiling water into a large teapot and putting rock\ncakes onto a plate.\n\n\u201cAnother Weasley, eh?\u201d said Hagrid, glancing at Ron\u2019s\nfreckles. \u201cI spent half me life chasin\u2019 yer twin brothers\naway from the forest.\u201d\n\nThe rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins\nthat almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron\npretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all\nabout their first lessons. Fang rested his head on\nHarry\u2019s knee and drooled all over his robes.\n\nHarry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call\nFilch \u201cthat old git.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn\u2019 as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I\u2019d like ter introduce\nher to Fang sometime. D\u2019yeh know, every time I go up\nter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can\u2019t get\nrid of her \u2014 Filch puts her up to it.\u201d\n\nHarry told Hagrid about Snape\u2019s lesson. Hagrid, like\nRon, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape\nliked hardly any of the students.\n\n\u201cBut he seemed to really hate me.\u201d\n\n\u201cRubbish!\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cWhy should he?\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 157 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nYet Harry couldn\u2019t help thinking that Hagrid didn\u2019t\nquite meet his eyes when he said that.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s yer brother Charlie?\u201d Hagrid asked Ron. \u201cI\nliked him a lot \u2014 great with animals.\u201d\n\nHarry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on\npurpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie\u2019s\nwork with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper\nthat was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was\na cutting from the Daily Prophet :\n\nGRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST\n\nInvestigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts\non 3 1 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark\nwizards or witches unknown.\n\nGringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had\nbeen taken. The vault that was searched had in fact\nbeen emptied the same day.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not telling you what was in there, so keep\nyour noses out if you know what\u2019s good for you,\u201d said\na Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.\n\nHarry remembered Ron telling him on the train that\nsomeone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn\u2019t\nmentioned the date.\n\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d said Harry, \u201cthat Gringotts break-in\nhappened on my birthday! It might\u2019ve been happening\nwhile we were there!\u201d\n\nThere was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn\u2019t\nmeet Harry\u2019s eyes this time. He grunted and offered\nhim another rock cake. Harry read the story again.\n\nThe vault that was searched had in fact been emptied\nearlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven\nPage | 158 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nhundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying,\ntaking out that grubby little package. Had that been\nwhat the thieves were looking for?\n\nAs Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for\ndinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes\nthey\u2019d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that\nnone of the lessons he\u2019d had so far had given him as\nmuch to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid\ncollected that package just in time? Where was it\nnow? And did Hagrid know something about Snape\nthat he didn\u2019t want to tell Harry?\n\n\n\nPage | 159 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\nTHE MIDNIGHT DUEL\n\nHarry had never believed he would meet a boy he\nhated more than Dudley, but that was before he met\nDraco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had\nPotions with the Slytherins, so they didn\u2019t have to put\nup with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn\u2019t until\nthey spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor\ncommon room that made them all groan. Flying\nlessons would be starting on Thursday \u2014 and\nGryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.\n\n\u201cTypical,\u201d said Harry darkly. \u201cJust what I always\nwanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in\nfront of Malfoy.\u201d\n\nHe had been looking forward to learning to fly more\nthan anything else.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that you\u2019ll make a fool of yourself,\u201d\nsaid Ron reasonably. \u201cAnyway, I know Malfoy\u2019s always\ngoing on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet\nthat\u2019s all talk.\u201d\n\nPage | 160 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\nMalfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He\ncomplained loudly about first years never getting on\nthe House Quidditch teams and told long, boastful\nstories that always seemed to end with him narrowly\nescaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn\u2019t the only\none, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he\u2019d\nspent most of his childhood zooming around the\ncountryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell\nanyone who\u2019d listen about the time he\u2019d almost hit a\nhang glider on Charlie\u2019s old broom. Everyone from\nwizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly.\nRon had already had a big argument with Dean\nThomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer.\nRon couldn\u2019t see what was exciting about a game with\nonly one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry\nhad caught Ron prodding Dean\u2019s poster of West Ham\nsoccer team, trying to make the players move.\n\nNeville had never been on a broomstick in his life,\nbecause his grandmother had never let him near one.\nPrivately, Harry felt she\u2019d had good reason, because\nNeville managed to have an extraordinary number of\naccidents even with both feet on the ground.\n\nHermione Granger was almost as nervous about\nflying as Neville was. This was something you couldn\u2019t\nlearn by heart out of a book \u2014 not that she hadn\u2019t\ntried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all\nstupid with flying tips she\u2019d gotten out of a library\nbook called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was\nhanging on to her every word, desperate for anything\nthat might help him hang on to his broomstick later,\nbut everybody else was very pleased when Hermione \u2019s\nlecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.\n\nHarry hadn\u2019t had a single letter since Hagrid\u2019s note,\nsomething that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of\ncourse. Malfoy \u2019s eagle owl was always bringing him\n\n\n\nPage | 161 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\npackages of sweets from home, which he opened\ngloatingly at the Slytherin table.\n\nA barn owl brought Neville a small package from his\ngrandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed\nthem a glass ball the size of a large marble, which\nseemed to be full of white smoke.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Remembrall!\u201d he explained. \u201cGran knows I\nforget things \u2014 this tells you if there\u2019s something\nyou\u2019ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this\nand if it turns red \u2014 oh ...\u201d His face fell, because the\nRemembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, \u201c... you\u2019ve\nforgotten something ...\u201d\n\nNeville was trying to remember what he\u2019d forgotten\nwhen Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor\ntable, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.\n\nHarry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half\nhoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor\nMcGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any\nteacher in the school, was there in a flash.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cMalfoy\u2019s got my Remembrall, Professor.\u201d\n\nScowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall\nback on the table.\n\n\u201cJust looking,\u201d he said, and he sloped away with\nCrabbe and Goyle behind him.\n\nAt three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the\nother Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto\nthe grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear,\nbreezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as\nthey marched down the sloping lawns toward a\nPage | 162 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nsmooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds\nto the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying\ndarkly in the distance.\n\nThe Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty\nbroomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry\nhad heard Fred and George Weasley complain about\nthe school brooms, saying that some of them started\nto vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly\nto the left.\n\nTheir teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short,\ngray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.\n\n\u201cWell, what are you all waiting for?\u201d she barked.\n\u201cEveryone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry\nup.\u201d "\n\nHarry glanced down at his broom. It was old and\nsome of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.\n\n\u201cStick out your right hand over your broom,\u201d called\nMadam Hooch at the front, \u201cand say \u2018Up!\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cUP!\u201d everyone shouted.\n\nHarry\u2019s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it\nwas one of the few that did. Hermione Granger\u2019s had\nsimply rolled over on the ground, and Neville\u2019s hadn\u2019t\nmoved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell\nwhen you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a\nquaver in Neville\u2019s voice that said only too clearly that\nhe wanted to keep his feet on the ground.\n\nMadam Hooch then showed them how to mount their\nbrooms without sliding off the end, and walked up\nand down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and\nRon were delighted when she told Malfoy he\u2019d been\ndoing it wrong for years.\n\nPage | 163 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNow, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the\nground, hard,\u201d said Madam Hooch. \u201cKeep your\nbrooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight\nback down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle\n\u2014 three \u2014 two \u2014 \u201d\n\nBut Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of\nbeing left on the ground, pushed off hard before the\nwhistle had touched Madam Hooch\u2019s lips.\n\n\u201cCome back, boy!\u201d she shouted, but Neville was rising\nstraight up like a cork shot out of a bottle \u2014 twelve\nfeet \u2014 twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face\nlook down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp,\nslip sideways off the broom and \u2014\n\nWHAM \u2014 a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay\nfacedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was\nstill rising higher and higher, and started to drift\nlazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.\n\nMadam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as\nwhite as his.\n\n\u201cBroken wrist,\u201d Harry heard her mutter. \u201cCome on,\nboy \u2014 it\u2019s all right, up you get.\u201d\n\nShe turned to the rest of the class.\n\n\u201cNone of you is to move while I take this boy to the\nhospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are\nor you\u2019ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say\n\u2018Quidditch.\u2019 Come on, dear.\u201d\n\nNeville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist,\nhobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm\naround him.\n\n\n\nPage | 164 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nNo sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst\ninto laughter.\n\n\u201cDid you see his face, the great lump?\u201d\n\nThe other Slytherins joined in.\n\n\u201cShut up, Malfoy,\u201d snapped Parvati Patil.\n\n\u201cOoh, sticking up for Longbottom?\u201d said Pansy\nParkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. \u201cNever thought\nyou\u2019d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook!\u201d said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching\nsomething out of the grass. \u201cIt\u2019s that stupid thing\nLongbottom\u2019s gran sent him.\u201d\n\nThe Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.\n\n\u201cGive that here, Malfoy,\u201d said Harry quietly. Everyone\nstopped talking to watch.\n\nMalfoy smiled nastily.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find\n\u2014 how about \u2014 up a tree?\u201d\n\n\u201cGive it here!\u201d Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto\nhis broomstick and taken off. He hadn\u2019t been lying, he\ncould fly well. Hovering level with the topmost\nbranches of an oak he called, \u201cCome and get it,\nPotter!\u201d\n\nHarry grabbed his broom.\n\n\u201ciVo!\u201d shouted Hermione Granger. \u201cMadam Hooch told\nus not to move \u2014 you\u2019ll get us all into trouble.\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 165 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nHarry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears.\n\nHe mounted the broom and kicked hard against the\nground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his\nhair, and his robes whipped out behind him \u2014 and in\na rush of fierce joy he realized he\u2019d found something\nhe could do without being taught \u2014 this was easy,\nthis was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a\nlittle to take it even higher, and heard screams and\ngasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring\nwhoop from Ron.\n\nHe turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in\nmidair. Malfoy looked stunned.\n\n\u201cGive it here,\u201d Harry called, \u201cor I\u2019ll knock you off that\nbroom!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking\nworried.\n\nHarry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward\nand grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it\nshot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got\nout of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-\nface and held the broom steady. A few people below\nwere clapping.\n\n\u201cNo Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck,\nMalfoy,\u201d Harry called.\n\nThe same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.\n\n\u201cCatch it if you can, then!\u201d he shouted, and he threw\nthe glass ball high into the air and streaked back\ntoward the ground.\n\nHarry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up\nin the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward\nand pointed his broom handle down \u2014 next second\n\nPage | 166 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nhe was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball\n\u2014 wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the\nscreams of people watching \u2014 he stretched out his\nhand \u2014 a foot from the ground he caught it, just in\ntime to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently\nonto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in\nhis fist.\n\n\u201cHARRY POTTER!\u201d\n\nHis heart sank faster than he\u2019d just dived. Professor\nMcGonagall was running toward them. He got to his\nfeet, trembling.\n\n\u201cNever \u2014 in all my time at Hogwarts \u2014 \u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall was almost speechless with\nshock, and her glasses flashed furiously, \u201c \u2014 how dare\nyou \u2014 might have broken your neck \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t his fault, Professor \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cBe quiet, Miss Patil \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cBut Malfoy \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.\u201d\n\nHarry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle\u2019s\ntriumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in\nProfessor McGonagall\u2019s wake as she strode toward the\ncastle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it.\n\nHe wanted to say something to defend himself, but\nthere seemed to be something wrong with his voice.\nProfessor McGonagall was sweeping along without\neven looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now\nhe\u2019d done it. He hadn\u2019t even lasted two weeks. He\u2019d be\npacking his bags in ten minutes. What would the\nDursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?\nPage | 167 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nUp the front steps, up the marble staircase inside,\nand still Professor McGonagall didn\u2019t say a word to\nhim. She wrenched open doors and marched along\ncorridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her.\nMaybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He\nthought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as\ngamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid\u2019s assistant.\nHis stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron\nand the others becoming wizards while he stumped\naround the grounds carrying Hagrid\u2019s bag.\n\nProfessor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom.\nShe opened the door and poked her head inside.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood\nfor a moment?\u201d\n\nWood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane\nshe was going to use on him?\n\nBut Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year\nboy who came out of Flitwick\u2019s class looking\nconfused.\n\n\u201cFollow me, you two,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, and\nthey marched on up the corridor, Wood looking\ncuriously at Harry.\n\n\u201cIn here.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom\nthat was empty except for Peeves, who was busy\nwriting rude words on the blackboard.\n\n\u201cOut, Peeves!\u201d she barked. Peeves threw the chalk\ninto a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out\ncursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door\nbehind him and turned to face the two boys.\n\n\n\nPage | 168 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPotter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood \u2014 I\u2019ve found you a\nSeeker.\u201d\n\nWood\u2019s expression changed from puzzlement to\ndelight.\n\n\u201cAre you serious, Professor?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d said Professor McGonagall crisply. \u201cThe\nboy\u2019s a natural. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. Was\nthat your first time on a broomstick, Potter?\u201d\n\nHarry nodded silently. He didn\u2019t have a clue what was\ngoing on, but he didn\u2019t seem to be being expelled, and\nsome of the feeling started coming back to his legs.\n\n\u201cHe caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot\ndive,\u201d Professor McGonagall told Wood. \u201cDidn\u2019t even\nscratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn\u2019t have done\nit.\u201d\n\nWood was now looking as though all his dreams had\ncome true at once.\n\n\u201cEver seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?\u201d he asked\nexcitedly.\n\n\u201cWood\u2019s captain of the Gryffindor team,\u201d Professor\nMcGonagall explained.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just the build for a Seeker, too,\u201d said Wood, now\nwalking around Harry and staring at him. \u201cLight \u2014\nspeedy \u2014 we\u2019ll have to get him a decent broom,\nProfessor \u2014 a Nimbus Two Thousand or a\nCleansweep Seven, I\u2019d say.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we\ncan\u2019t bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need\na better team than last year. Flattened in that last\n\nPage | 169 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nmatch by Slytherin, I couldn\u2019t look Severus Snape in\nthe face for weeks. ...\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses\nat Harry.\n\n\u201cI want to hear you\u2019re training hard, Potter, or I may\nchange my mind about punishing you.\u201d\n\nThen she suddenly smiled.\n\n\u201cYour father would have been proud,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\nwas an excellent Quidditch player himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d\n\nIt was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron\nwhat had happened when he\u2019d left the grounds with\nProfessor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and\nkidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he\u2019d forgotten all\nabout it.\n\n\u201cSeeker?\u201d he said. \u201cBut first years never \u2014 you must\nbe the youngest House player in about \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201c \u2014 a century,\u201d said Harry, shoveling pie into his\nmouth. He felt particularly hungry after the\nexcitement of the afternoon. \u201cWood told me.\u201d\n\nRon was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and\ngaped at Harry.\n\n\u201cI start training next week,\u201d said Harry. \u201cOnly don\u2019t\ntell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.\u201d\n\nFred and George Weasley now came into the hall,\nspotted Harry, and hurried over.\n\n\n\nPage | 170 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWell done,\u201d said George in a low voice. \u201cWood told us.\nWe\u2019re on the team too \u2014 Beaters.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tell you, we\u2019re going to win that Quidditch Cup for\nsure this year,\u201d said Fred. \u201cWe haven\u2019t won since\nCharlie left, but this year\u2019s team is going to be\nbrilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost\nskipping when he told us.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyway, we\u2019ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he\u2019s\nfound a new secret passageway out of the school.\u201d\n\n\u201cBet it\u2019s that one behind the statue of Gregory the\nSmarmy that we found in our first week. See you.\u201d\n\nFred and George had hardly disappeared when\nsomeone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked\nby Crabbe and Goyle.\n\n\u201cHaving a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the\ntrain back to the Muggles?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lot braver now that you\u2019re back on the\nground and you\u2019ve got your little friends with you,\u201d\nsaid Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all\nlittle about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table\nwas full of teachers, neither of them could do more\nthan crack their knuckles and scowl.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d take you on anytime on my own,\u201d said Malfoy.\n\u201cTonight, if you want. Wizard\u2019s duel. Wands only \u2014\nno contact. What\u2019s the matter? Never heard of a\nwizard\u2019s duel before, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course he has,\u201d said Ron, wheeling around. \u201cI\u2019m\nhis second, who\u2019s yours?\u201d\n\nMalfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.\n\n\n\nPage | 171 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCrabbe,\u201d he said. \u201cMidnight all right? Well meet you\nin the trophy room; that\u2019s always unlocked.\u201d\n\nWhen Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each\nother.\n\n\u201cWhat is a wizard\u2019s duel?\u201d said Harry. \u201cAnd what do\nyou mean, you\u2019re my second?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, a second\u2019s there to take over if you die,\u201d said\nRon casually, getting started at last on his cold pie.\nCatching the look on Harry\u2019s face, he added quickly,\n\u201cBut people only die in proper duels, you know, with\nreal wizards. The most you and Malfoy\u2019ll be able to do\nis send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows\nenough magic to do any real damage. I bet he\nexpected you to refuse, anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?\u201d\n\n\u201cThrow it away and punch him on the nose,\u201d Ron\nsuggested.\n\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d\n\nThey both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t a person eat in peace in this place?\u201d said Ron.\n\nHermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t help overhearing what you and Malfoy\nwere saying \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cBet you could,\u201d Ron muttered.\n\n\u201c \u2014 and you mustn\u2019t go wandering around the school\nat night, think of the points you\u2019ll lose Gryffindor if\n\n\n\nPage | 172 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nyou\u2019re caught, and you\u2019re bound to be. It\u2019s really very\nselfish of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s really none of your business,\u201d said Harry.\n\u201cGood-bye,\u201d said Ron.\n\nAll the same, it wasn\u2019t what you\u2019d call the perfect end\nto the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later\nlistening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville\nwasn\u2019t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent\nall evening giving him advice such as \u201cIf he tries to\ncurse you, you\u2019d better dodge it, because I can\u2019t\nremember how to block them.\u201d There was a very good\nchance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs.\nNorris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck,\nbreaking another school rule today. On the other\nhand, Malfoy\u2019s sneering face kept looming up out of\nthe darkness \u2014 this was his big chance to beat\nMalfoy face-to-face. He couldn\u2019t miss it.\n\n\u201cHalf-past eleven,\u201d Ron muttered at last, \u201cwe\u2019d better\ngo.\u201d\n\nThey pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their\nwands, and crept across the tower room, down the\nspiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common\nroom. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace,\nturning all the armchairs into hunched black\nshadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole\nwhen a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, \u201cI\ncan\u2019t believe you\u2019re going to do this, Harry.\u201d\n\nA lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger,\nwearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.\n\n\u201cYou!\u201d said Ron furiously. \u201cGo back to bed!\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 173 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI almost told your brother,\u201d Hermione snapped,\n\n\u201cPercy \u2014 he\u2019s a prefect, he\u2019d put a stop to this.\u201d\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t believe anyone could be so interfering.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d he said to Ron. He pushed open the\nportrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole.\n\nHermione wasn\u2019t going to give up that easily. She\nfollowed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at\nthem like an angry goose.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care\nabout yourselves, / don\u2019t want Slytherin to win the\nHouse Cup, and you\u2019ll lose all the points I got from\nProfessor McGonagall for knowing about Switching\nSpells.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo away.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, but I warned you, you just remember what\nI said when you\u2019re on the train home tomorrow,\nyou\u2019re so \u2014 \u201d\n\nBut what they were, they didn\u2019t find out. Hermione\nhad turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back\ninside and found herself facing an empty painting.\n\nThe Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and\nHermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower.\n\n\u201cNow what am I going to do?\u201d she asked shrilly.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s your problem,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go,\nwe\u2019re going to be late.\u201d\n\nThey hadn\u2019t even reached the end of the corridor\nwhen Hermione caught up with them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming with you,\u201d she said.\n\nPage | 174 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou are not.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cD\u2019you think I\u2019m going to stand out here and wait for\nFilch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I\u2019ll tell\nhim the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you\ncan back me up.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve \u2014 \u201d said Ron loudly.\n\n\u201cShut up, both of you!\u201d said Harry sharply. \u201cI heard\nsomething.\u201d\n\nIt was a sort of snuffling.\n\n\u201cMrs. Norris?\u201d breathed Ron, squinting through the\ndark.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up\non the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake\nas they crept nearer.\n\n\u201cThank goodness you found me! I\u2019ve been out here for\nhours, I couldn\u2019t remember the new password to get\nin to bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep your voice down, Neville. The password\u2019s \u2018Pig\nsnout\u2019 but it won\u2019t help you now, the Fat Lady\u2019s gone\noff somewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s your arm?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d said Neville, showing them. \u201cMadam Pomfrey\nmended it in about a minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood \u2014 well, look, Neville, we\u2019ve got to be\nsomewhere, we\u2019ll see you later \u2014 \u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 175 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t leave me!\u201d said Neville, scrambling to his feet,\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron\u2019s\nbeen past twice already.\u201d\n\nRon looked at his watch and then glared furiously at\nHermione and Neville.\n\n\u201cIf either of you get us caught, I\u2019ll never rest until I\u2019ve\nlearned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us\nabout, and used it on you.\u201d\n\nHermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron\nexactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry\nhissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all\nforward.\n\nThey flitted along corridors striped with bars of\nmoonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry\nexpected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they\nwere lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor\nand tiptoed toward the trophy room.\n\nMalfoy and Crabbe weren\u2019t there yet. The crystal\ntrophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught\nthem. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver\nand gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls,\nkeeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the\nroom. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in\nand started at once. The minutes crept by.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s late, maybe he\u2019s chickened out,\u201d Ron whispered.\n\nThen a noise in the next room made them jump.\n\nHarry had only just raised his wand when they heard\nsomeone speak \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t Malfoy.\n\n\u201cSniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a\ncorner.\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 176 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nIt was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck,\nHarry waved madly at the other three to follow him as\nquickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the\ndoor, away from Filch\u2019s voice. Neville\u2019s robes had\nbarely whipped round the corner when they heard\nFilch enter the trophy room.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in here somewhere,\u201d they heard him mutter,\n\u201cprobably hiding.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis way!\u201d Harry mouthed to the others and,\npetrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full\nof suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting\nnearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak\nand broke into a run \u2014 he tripped, grabbed Ron\naround the waist, and the pair of them toppled right\ninto a suit of armor.\n\nThe clanging and crashing were enough to wake the\nwhole castle.\n\n\u201cRUN!\u201d Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted\ndown the gallery, not looking back to see whether\nFilch was following \u2014 they swung around the\ndoorpost and galloped down one corridor then\nanother, Harry in the lead, without any idea where\nthey were or where they were going \u2014 they ripped\nthrough a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden\npassageway, hurtled along it and came out near their\nCharms classroom, which they knew was miles from\nthe trophy room.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve lost him,\u201d Harry panted, leaning against\nthe cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was\nbent double, wheezing and spluttering.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 told \u2014 you,\u201d Hermione gasped, clutching at the\nstitch in her chest, \u201cI \u2014 told \u2014 you.\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 177 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,\u201d said Ron,\n\u201cquickly as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cMalfoy tricked you,\u201d Hermione said to Harry. \u201cYou\nrealize that, don\u2019t you? He was never going to meet\nyou \u2014 Filch knew someone was going to be in the\ntrophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.\u201d\n\nHarry thought she was probably right, but he wasn\u2019t\ngoing to tell her that.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t going to be that simple. They hadn\u2019t gone\nmore than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled\nand something came shooting out of a classroom in\nfront of them.\n\nIt was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a\nsqueal of delight.\n\n\u201cShut up, Peeves \u2014 please \u2014 you\u2019ll get us thrown\nout.\u201d\n\nPeeves cackled.\n\n\u201cWandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut,\ntut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you\u2019ll get caughty.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot if you don\u2019t give us away, Peeves, please.\u201d\n\n\u201cShould tell Filch, I should,\u201d said Peeves in a sanity\nvoice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. \u201cIt\u2019s for your\nown good, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet out of the way,\u201d snapped Ron, taking a swipe at\nPeeves \u2014 this was a big mistake.\n\n\n\nPage | 178 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSTUDENTS OUT OF BED!\u201d Peeves bellowed,\n\u201cSTUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS\nCORRIDOR!\u201d\n\nDucking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right\nto the end of the corridor where they slammed into a\ndoor \u2014 and it was locked.\n\n\u201cThis is it!\u201d Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at\nthe door, \u201cWe\u2019re done for! This is the end!\u201d\n\nThey could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he\ncould toward Peeves \u2019s shouts.\n\n\u201cOh, move over,\u201d Hermione snarled. She grabbed\nHarry\u2019s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered,\n\u201cAlohomora\u201d\n\nThe lock clicked and the door swung open \u2014 they\npiled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their\nears against it, listening.\n\n\u201cWhich way did they go, Peeves?\u201d Filch was saying.\n\u201cQuick, tell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay \u2018please.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?\u201d\n\n\u201cShan\u2019t say nothing if you don\u2019t say please,\u201d said\nPeeves in his annoying singsong voice.\n\n\u201cAll right \u2014 please.\u201d\n\n\u201cNOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn\u2019t say nothing\nif you didn\u2019t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!\u201d And they\nheard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch\ncursing in rage.\n\n\n\nPage | 179 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe thinks this door is locked,\u201d Harry whispered. \u201cI\nthink well be okay \u2014 get off Neville!\u201d For Neville had\nbeen tugging on the sleeve of Harry\u2019s bathrobe for the\nlast minute. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nHarry turned around \u2014 and saw, quite clearly, what.\nFor a moment, he was sure he\u2019d walked into a\nnightmare \u2014 this was too much, on top of everything\nthat had happened so far.\n\nThey weren\u2019t in a room, as he had supposed. They\nwere in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third\nfloor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.\n\nThey were looking straight into the eyes of a\nmonstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space\nbetween ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three\npairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and\nquivering in their direction; three drooling mouths,\nsaliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.\n\nIt was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them,\nand Harry knew that the only reason they weren\u2019t\nalready dead was that their sudden appearance had\ntaken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over\nthat, there was no mistaking what those thunderous\ngrowls meant.\n\nHarry groped for the doorknob \u2014 between Filch and\ndeath, he\u2019d take Filch.\n\nThey fell backward \u2014 Harry slammed the door shut,\nand they ran, they almost flew, back down the\ncorridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them\nsomewhere else, because they didn\u2019t see him\nanywhere, but they hardly cared \u2014 all they wanted to\ndo was put as much space as possible between them\nand that monster. They didn\u2019t stop running until they\n\n\n\nPage | 180 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nreached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh\nfloor.\n\n\u201cWhere on earth have you all been?\u201d she asked,\nlooking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders\nand their flushed, sweaty faces.\n\n\u201cNever mind that \u2014 pig snout, pig snout,\u201d panted\nHarry, and the portrait swung forward. They\nscrambled into the common room and collapsed,\ntrembling, into armchairs.\n\nIt was a while before any of them said anything.\nNeville, indeed, looked as if he\u2019d never speak again.\n\n\u201cWhat do they think they\u2019re doing, keeping a thing\nlike that locked up in a school?\u201d said Ron finally. \u201cIf\nany dog needs exercise, that one does.\u201d\n\nHermione had got both her breath and her bad\ntemper back again.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t use your eyes, any of you, do you?\u201d she\nsnapped. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see what it was standing on?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe floor?\u201d Harry suggested. \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking at its\nfeet, I was too busy with its heads.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It\u2019s\nobviously guarding something.\u201d\n\nShe stood up, glaring at them.\n\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re pleased with yourselves. We could all\nhave been killed \u2014 or worse, expelled. Now, if you\ndon\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d\n\nRon stared after her, his mouth open.\n\n\n\nPage | 181 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, we don\u2019t mind,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d think we dragged\nher along, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nBut Hermione had given Harry something else to\nthink about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was\nguarding something. . . . What had Hagrid said?\nGringotts was the safest place in the world for\nsomething you wanted to hide \u2014 except perhaps\nHogwarts.\n\nIt looked as though Harry had found out where the\ngrubby little package from vault seven hundred and\nthirteen was.\n\n\n\nPage | 182 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\nHALLOWEEN\n\nMalfoy couldn\u2019t believe his eyes when he saw that\nHarry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day,\nlooking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the\nnext morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting\nthe three-headed dog had been an excellent\nadventure, and they were quite keen to have another\none. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the\npackage that seemed to have been moved from\nGringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time\nwondering what could possibly need such heavy\nprotection.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s either really valuable or really dangerous,\u201d said\nRon.\n\n\u201cOr both,\u201d said Harry.\n\nBut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious\nobject was that it was about two inches long, they\ndidn\u2019t have much chance of guessing what it was\nwithout further clues.\n\nPage | 183 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\nNeither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest\ninterest in what lay underneath the dog and the\ntrapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near\nthe dog again.\n\nHermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and\nRon, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they\nsaw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted\nnow was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their\ngreat delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail\nabout a week later.\n\nAs the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual,\neveryone\u2019s attention was caught at once by a long,\nthin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry\nwas just as interested as everyone else to see what\nwas in this large parcel, and was amazed when the\nowls soared down and dropped it right in front of him,\nknocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly\nfluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a\nletter on top of the parcel.\n\nHarry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky,\nbecause it said:\n\n\n\nDO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.\n\nIt contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I\ndon\u2019t want everybody knowing you\u2019ve got a\nbroomstick or they\u2019ll all want one. Oliver Wood will\nmeet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven\no\u2019clock for your first training session.\n\nProfessor M. McGonagall\n\nHarry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the\nnote to Ron to read.\n\nPage | 184 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cA Nimbus Two Thousand!\u201d Ron moaned enviously.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never even touched one.\u201d\n\nThey left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the\nbroomstick in private before their first class, but\nhalfway across the entrance hall they found the way\nupstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized\nthe package from Harry and felt it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a broomstick,\u201d he said, throwing it back to\nHarry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren\u2019t\nallowed them.\u201d\n\nRon couldn\u2019t resist it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not any old broomstick,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s a Nimbus\nTwo Thousand. What did you say you\u2019ve got at home,\nMalfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?\u201d Ron grinned at Harry.\n\u201cComets look flashy, but they\u2019re not in the same\nleague as the Nimbus.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would you know about it, Weasley, you\ncouldn\u2019t afford half the handle,\u201d Malfoy snapped back.\n\u201cI suppose you and your brothers have to save up\ntwig by twig.\u201d\n\nBefore Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared\nat Malfoy\u2019s elbow.\n\n\u201cNot arguing, I hope, boys?\u201d he squeaked.\n\n\u201cPotters been sent a broomstick, Professor,\u201d said\nMalfoy quickly.\n\n\u201cYes, yes, that\u2019s right,\u201d said Professor Flitwick,\nbeaming at Harry. \u201cProfessor McGonagall told me all\nabout the special circumstances, Potter. And what\nmodel is it?\u201d\n\nPage | 185 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cA Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,\u201d said Harry, fighting\nnot to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy\u2019s face.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s really thanks to Malfoy here that I\u2019ve got it,\u201d\nhe added.\n\nHarry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their\nlaughter at Malfoy\u2019s obvious rage and confusion.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s true,\u201d Harry chortled as they reached the\ntop of the marble staircase, \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t stolen\nNeville\u2019s Remembrall I wouldn\u2019t be on the team. ...\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I suppose you think that\u2019s a reward for breaking\nrules?\u201d came an angry voice from just behind them.\nHermione was stomping up the stairs, looking\ndisapprovingly at the package in Harry\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t speaking to us?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYes, don\u2019t stop now,\u201d said Ron, \u201cit\u2019s doing us so\nmuch good.\u201d\n\nHermione marched away with her nose in the air.\n\nHarry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his\nlessons that day. It kept wandering up to the\ndormitory where his new broomstick was lying under\nhis bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where\nhe\u2019d be learning to play that night. He bolted his\ndinner that evening without noticing what he was\neating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap\nthe Nimbus Two Thousand at last.\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto\nHarry\u2019s bedspread.\n\nEven Harry, who knew nothing about the different\nbrooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and\nshiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of\n\nPage | 186 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nneat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand\nwritten in gold near the top.\n\nAs seven o\u2019clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and\nset off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. He\u2019d\nnever been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of\nseats were raised in stands around the field so that\nthe spectators were high enough to see what was\ngoing on. At either end of the field were three golden\npoles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of\nthe little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles\nthrough, except that they were fifty feet high.\n\nToo eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry\nmounted his broomstick and kicked off from the\nground. What a feeling \u2014 he swooped in and out of\nthe goal posts and then sped up and down the field.\nThe Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he\nwanted at his lightest touch.\n\n\u201cHey, Potter, come down!\u201d\n\nOliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large\nwooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to\nhim.\n\n\u201cVery nice,\u201d said Wood, his eyes glinting. \u201cI see what\nMcGonagall meant ... you really are a natural. I\u2019m\njust going to teach you the rules this evening, then\nyou\u2019ll be joining team practice three times a week.\u201d\n\nHe opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized\nballs.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Wood. \u201cNow, Quidditch is easy enough to\nunderstand, even if it\u2019s not too easy to play. There are\nseven players on each side. Three of them are called\nChasers.\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 187 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThree Chasers,\u201d Harry repeated, as Wood took out a\nbright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.\n\n\u201cThis ball\u2019s called the Quaffle,\u201d said Wood. \u201cThe\nChasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and\nget it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten\npoints every time the Quaffle goes through one of the\nhoops. Follow me?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through\nthe hoops to score,\u201d Harry recited. \u201cSo \u2014 that\u2019s sort of\nlike basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn\u2019t\nit?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s basketball?\u201d said Wood curiously.\n\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d said Harry quickly.\n\n\u201cNow, there\u2019s another player on each side who\u2019s called\nthe Keeper \u2014 I\u2019m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly\naround our hoops and stop the other team from\nscoring.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree Chasers, one Keeper,\u201d said Harry, who was\ndetermined to remember it all. \u201cAnd they play with\nthe Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?\u201d He\npointed at the three balls left inside the box.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll show you now,\u201d said Wood. \u201cTake this.\u201d\n\nHe handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short\nbaseball bat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to show you what the Bludgers do,\u201d Wood\nsaid. \u201cThese two are the Bludgers.\u201d\n\nHe showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and\nslightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed\n\n\n\nPage | 188 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nthat they seemed to be straining to escape the straps\nholding them inside the box.\n\n\u201cStand back,\u201d Wood warned Harry. He bent down and\nfreed one of the Bludgers.\n\nAt once, the black ball rose high in the air and then\npelted straight at Harry\u2019s face. Harry swung at it with\nthe bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it\nzigzagging away into the air \u2014 it zoomed around their\nheads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it\nand managed to pin it to the ground.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger\nback into the crate and strapping it down safely. \u201cThe\nBludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off\ntheir brooms. That\u2019s why you have two Beaters on\neach team \u2014 the Weasley twins are ours \u2014 it\u2019s their\njob to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and\nknock them toward the other team. So \u2014 think you\u2019ve\ngot all that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThree Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the\nKeeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the\nBludgers away from their team,\u201d Harry reeled off.\n\n\u201cVery good,\u201d said Wood.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?\u201d Harry\nasked, hoping he sounded offhand.\n\n\u201cNever at Hogwarts. We\u2019ve had a couple of broken\njaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last\nmember of the team is the Seeker. That\u2019s you. And\nyou don\u2019t have to worry about the Quaffle or the\nBludgers \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201c \u2014 unless they crack my head open.\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 189 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for\nthe Bludgers \u2014 I mean, they\u2019re like a pair of human\nBludgers themselves.\u201d\n\nWood reached into the crate and took out the fourth\nand last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the\nBludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut.\nIt was bright gold and had little fluttering silver\nwings.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d said Wood, \u201cis the Golden Snitch, and it\u2019s the\nmost important ball of the lot. It\u2019s very hard to catch\nbecause it\u2019s so fast and difficult to see. It\u2019s the\nSeeker\u2019s job to catch it. You\u2019ve got to weave in and out\nof the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get\nit before the other team\u2019s Seeker, because whichever\nSeeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra\nhundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win.\nThat\u2019s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of\nQuidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it\ncan go on for ages \u2014 I think the record is three\nmonths, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so\nthe players could get some sleep.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s it \u2014 any questions?\u201d\n\nHarry shook his head. He understood what he had to\ndo all right, it was doing it that was going to be the\nproblem.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t practice with the Snitch yet,\u201d said Wood,\ncarefully shutting it back inside the crate, \u201cit\u2019s too\ndark, we might lose it. Let\u2019s try you out with a few of\nthese.\u201d\n\nHe pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket\nand a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the\nair, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could\nin every direction for Harry to catch.\n\nPage | 190 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nHarry didn\u2019t miss a single one, and Wood was\ndelighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen\nand they couldn\u2019t carry on.\n\n\u201cThat Quidditch Cup\u2019ll have our name on it this year,\u201d\nsaid Wood happily as they trudged back up to the\ncastle. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you turn out better\nthan Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for\nEngland if he hadn\u2019t gone off chasing dragons.\u201d\n\nPerhaps it was because he was now so busy, what\nwith Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top\nof all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it\nwhen he realized that he\u2019d already been at Hogwarts\ntwo months. The castle felt more like home than\nPrivet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming\nmore and more interesting now that they had\nmastered the basics.\n\nOn Halloween morning they woke to the delicious\nsmell of baking pumpkin wafting through the\ncorridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced\nin Charms that he thought they were ready to start\nmaking objects fly, something they had all been dying\nto try since they\u2019d seen him make Neville\u2019s toad zoom\naround the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the\nclass into pairs to practice. Harry\u2019s partner was\nSeamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville\nhad been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was\nto be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to\ntell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this.\nShe hadn\u2019t spoken to either of them since the day\nHarry\u2019s broomstick had arrived.\n\n\u201cNow, don\u2019t forget that nice wrist movement we\u2019ve\nbeen practicing!\u201d squeaked Professor Flitwick,\nperched on top of his pile of books as usual. \u201cSwish\nand flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the\nmagic words properly is very important, too \u2014 never\nPage | 191 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nforget Wizard Baruffio, who said \u2018s\u2019 instead of \u2018f and\nfound himself on the floor with a buffalo on his\nchest.\u201d\n\nIt was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and\nflicked, but the feather they were supposed to be\nsending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got\nso impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set\nfire to it \u2014 Harry had to put it out with his hat.\n\nRon, at the next table, wasn\u2019t having much more\nluck.\n\n\u201cWingardium Leviosal\u201d he shouted, waving his long\narms like a windmill.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying it wrong,\u201d Harry heard Hermione snap.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the \u2018gar\u2019 nice and\nlong.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do it, then, if you\u2019re so clever,\u201d Ron snarled.\n\nHermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked\nher wand, and said, \u201cWingardium LeviosaV\u2019\n\nTheir feather rose off the desk and hovered about four\nfeet above their heads.\n\n\u201cOh, well done!\u201d cried Professor Flitwick, clapping.\n\u201cEveryone see here, Miss Granger\u2019s done it!\u201d\n\nRon was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder no one can stand her,\u201d he said to\nHarry as they pushed their way into the crowded\ncorridor, \u201cshe\u2019s a nightmare, honestly.\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 192 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nSomeone knocked into Harry as they hurried past\nhim. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her\nface \u2014 and was startled to see that she was in tears.\n\n\u201cI think she heard you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable.\n\u201cShe must\u2019ve noticed she\u2019s got no friends.\u201d\n\nHermione didn\u2019t turn up for the next class and wasn\u2019t\nseen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great\nHall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard\nParvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione\nwas crying in the girls\u2019 bathroom and wanted to be\nleft alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but\na moment later they had entered the Great Hall,\nwhere the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of\ntheir minds.\n\nA thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and\nceiling while a thousand more swooped over the\ntables in low black clouds, making the candles in the\npumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on\nthe golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term\nbanquet.\n\nHarry was just helping himself to a baked potato\nwhen Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall,\nhis turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone\nstared as he reached Professor Dumbledore\u2019s chair,\nslumped against the table, and gasped, \u201cTroll \u2014 in\nthe dungeons \u2014 thought you ought to know.\u201d\n\nHe then sank to the floor in a dead faint.\n\nThere was an uproar. It took several purple\nfirecrackers exploding from the end of Professor\nDumbledore\u2019s wand to bring silence.\n\n\n\nPage | 193 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPrefects,\u201d he rumbled, \u201clead your Houses back to the\ndormitories immediately!\u201d\n\nPercy was in his element.\n\n\u201cFollow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear\nthe troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind\nme, now. Make way, first years coming through!\nExcuse me, I\u2019m a prefect!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could a troll get in?\u201d Harry asked as they\nclimbed the stairs.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask me, they\u2019re supposed to be really stupid,\u201d\nsaid Ron. \u201cMaybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween\njoke.\u201d\n\nThey passed different groups of people hurrying in\ndifferent directions. As they jostled their way through\na crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly\ngrabbed Ron\u2019s arm.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just thought \u2014 Hermione.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about her?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know about the troll.\u201d\n\nRon bit his lip.\n\n\u201cOh, all right,\u201d he snapped. \u201cBut Percy\u2019d better not\nsee us.\u201d\n\nDucking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the\nother way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and\nhurried off toward the girls\u2019 bathroom. They had just\nturned the corner when they heard quick footsteps\nbehind them.\n\n\n\nPage | 194 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPercy!\u201d hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large\nstone griffin.\n\nPeering around it, however, they saw not Percy but\nSnape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from\nview.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing?\u201d Harry whispered. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he\ndown in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?\u201d\n\n\u201cSearch me.\u201d\n\nQuietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor\nafter Snape \u2019s fading footsteps.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s heading for the third floor,\u201d Harry said, but Ron\nheld up his hand.\n\n\u201cCan you smell something?\u201d\n\nHarry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a\nmixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no\none seems to clean.\n\nAnd then they heard it \u2014 a low grunting, and the\nshuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed \u2014 at\nthe end of a passage to the left, something huge was\nmoving toward them. They shrank into the shadows\nand watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.\n\nIt was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a\ndull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder\nwith its small bald head perched on top like a\ncoconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with\nflat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was\nincredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which\ndragged along the floor because its arms were so long.\n\n\n\nPage | 195 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nThe troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside.\nIt waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then\nslouched slowly into the room.\n\n\u201cThe key\u2019s in the lock,\u201d Harry muttered. \u201cWe could\nlock it in.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood idea,\u201d said Ron nervously.\n\nThey edged toward the open door, mouths dry,\npraying the troll wasn\u2019t about to come out of it. With\none great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam\nthe door, and lock it.\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d\n\nFlushed with their victory, they started to run back\nup the passage, but as they reached the corner they\nheard something that made their hearts stop \u2014 a\nhigh, petrified scream \u2014 and it was coming from the\nchamber they\u2019d just chained up.\n\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the girls\u2019 bathroom!\u201d Harry gasped.\n\n\u201c Hermionel\u201d they said together.\n\nIt was the last thing they wanted to do, but what\nchoice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted\nback to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their\npanic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran\ninside.\n\nHermione Granger was shrinking against the wall\nopposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll\nwas advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the\nwalls as it went.\n\n\n\nPage | 196 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cConfuse it!\u201d Harry said desperately to Ron, and,\nseizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against\nthe wall.\n\nThe troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It\nlumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had\nmade the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It\nhesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club\nas it went.\n\n\u201cOy, pea-brain!\u201d yelled Ron from the other side of the\nchamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll\ndidn\u2019t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its\nshoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again,\nturning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving\nHarry time to run around it.\n\n\u201cCome on, run, run\u201d Harry yelled at Hermione, trying\nto pull her toward the door, but she couldn\u2019t move,\nshe was still flat against the wall, her mouth open\nwith terror.\n\nThe shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the\ntroll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron,\nwho was nearest and had no way to escape.\n\nHarry then did something that was both very brave\nand very stupid: He took a great running jump and\nmanaged to fasten his arms around the troll\u2019s neck\nfrom behind. The troll couldn\u2019t feel Harry hanging\nthere, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit\nof wood up its nose, and Harry\u2019s wand had still been\nin his hand when he\u2019d jumped \u2014 it had gone straight\nup one of the troll\u2019s nostrils.\n\nHowling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its\nclub, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second,\nthe troll was going to rip him off or catch him a\nterrible blow with the club.\n\nPage | 197 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nHermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled\nout his own wand \u2014 not knowing what he was going\nto do he heard himself cry the first spell that came\ninto his head: \u201cWingardium Leviosal\u201d\n\nThe club flew suddenly out of the troll\u2019s hand, rose\nhigh, high up into the air, turned slowly over \u2014 and\ndropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner\u2019s\nhead. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat\non its face, with a thud that made the whole room\ntremble.\n\nHarry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of\nbreath. Ron was standing there with his wand still\nraised, staring at what he had done.\n\nIt was Hermione who spoke first.\n\n\u201cIs it \u2014 dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI think it\u2019s just been\nknocked out.\u201d\n\nHe bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll\u2019s\nnose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray\nglue.\n\n\u201cUrgh \u2014 troll boogers.\u201d\n\nHe wiped it on the troll\u2019s trousers.\n\nA sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the\nthree of them look up. They hadn\u2019t realized what a\nracket they had been making, but of course, someone\ndownstairs must have heard the crashes and the\ntroll\u2019s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall\nhad come bursting into the room, closely followed by\nSnape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell\n\n\n\nPage | 198 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\ntook one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and\nsat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.\n\nSnape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was\nlooking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her\nlook so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning\nfifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry\u2019s\nmind.\n\n\u201cWhat on earth were you thinking of?\u201d said Professor\nMcGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked\nat Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the\nair. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you weren\u2019t killed. Why aren\u2019t you\nin your dormitory?\u201d\n\nSnape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked\nat the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down.\n\nThen a small voice came out of the shadows.\n\n\u201cPlease, Professor McGonagall \u2014 they were looking for\nme.\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss Granger!\u201d\n\nHermione had managed to get to her feet at last.\n\n\u201cI went looking for the troll because I \u2014 I thought I\ncould deal with it on my own \u2014 you know, because\nI\u2019ve read all about them.\u201d\n\nRon dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a\ndownright lie to a teacher?\n\n\u201cIf they hadn\u2019t found me, I\u2019d be dead now. Harry\nstuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out\nwith its own club. They didn\u2019t have time to come and\nfetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they\narrived.\u201d\n\nPage | 199 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nHarry and Ron tried to look as though this story\nwasn\u2019t new to them.\n\n\u201cWell \u2014 in that case ...\u201d said Professor McGonagall,\nstaring at the three of them, \u201cMiss Granger, you\nfoolish girl, how could you think of tackling a\nmountain troll on your own?\u201d\n\nHermione hung her head. Harry was speechless.\nHermione was the last person to do anything against\nthe rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to\nget them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started\nhanding out sweets.\n\n\u201cMiss Granger, five points will be taken from\nGryffindor for this,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cI\u2019m\nvery disappointed in you. If you\u2019re not hurt at all,\nyou\u2019d better get off to Gryffindor Tower. Students are\nfinishing the feast in their Houses.\u201d\n\nHermione left.\n\nProfessor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.\n\n\u201cWell, I still say you were lucky, but not many first\nyears could have taken on a full-grown mountain\ntroll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor\nDumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.\u201d\n\nThey hurried out of the chamber and didn\u2019t speak at\nall until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief\nto be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from\nanything else.\n\n\u201cWe should have gotten more than ten points,\u201d Ron\ngrumbled.\n\n\u201cFive, you mean, once she\u2019s taken off Hermione \u2019s.\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 200 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGood of her to get us out of trouble like that,\u201d Ron\nadmitted. \u201cMind you, we did save her.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe might not have needed saving if we hadn\u2019t\nlocked the thing in with her,\u201d Harry reminded him.\n\nThey had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.\n\n\u201cPig snout,\u201d they said and entered.\n\nThe common room was packed and noisy. Everyone\nwas eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione,\nhowever, stood alone by the door, waiting for them.\nThere was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of\nthem looking at each other, they all said \u201cThanks,\u201d\nand hurried off to get plates.\n\nBut from that moment on, Hermione Granger became\ntheir friend. There are some things you can\u2019t share\nwithout ending up liking each other, and knocking\nout a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.\n\n\n\nPage | 201 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\nQUIDDITCH\n\nAs they entered November, the weather turned very\ncold. The mountains around the school became icy\ngray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the\nground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen\nfrom the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on\nthe Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin\novercoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin\nboots.\n\nThe Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry\nwould be playing in his first match after weeks of\ntraining: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor\nwon, they would move up into second place in the\nHouse Championship.\n\nHardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood\nhad decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry\nshould be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was\nplaying Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry\ndidn\u2019t know which was worse \u2014 people telling him\nhe\u2019d be brilliant or people telling him they\u2019d be\nrunning around underneath him holding a mattress.\nPage | 202 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\nIt was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a\nfriend. He didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d have gotten through\nall his homework without her, what with all the last-\nminute Quidditch practice Wood was making them\ndo. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages,\nwhich turned out to be a very interesting read.\n\nHarry learned that there were seven hundred ways of\ncommitting a Quidditch foul and that all of them had\nhappened during a World Cup match in 1473; that\nSeekers were usually the smallest and fastest players,\nand that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to\nhappen to them; that although people rarely died\nplaying Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish\nand turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.\n\nHermione had become a bit more relaxed about\nbreaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her\nfrom the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for\nit. The day before Harry\u2019s first Quidditch match the\nthree of them were out in the freezing courtyard\nduring break, and she had conjured them up a bright\nblue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.\nThey were standing with their backs to it, getting\nwarm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at\nonce that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and\nHermione moved closer together to block the fire from\nview; they were sure it wouldn\u2019t be allowed.\nUnfortunately, something about their guilty faces\ncaught Snape\u2019s eye. He limped over. He hadn\u2019t seen\nthe fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to\ntell them off anyway.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that you\u2019ve got there, Potter?\u201d\n\nIt was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.\n\n\n\nPage | 203 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLibrary books are not to be taken outside the\nschool,\u201d said Snape. \u201cGive it to me. Five points from\nGryffindor.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just made that rule up,\u201d Harry muttered angrily\nas Snape limped away. \u201cWonder what\u2019s wrong with\nhis leg?\u201d\n\n\u201cDunno, but I hope it\u2019s really hurting him,\u201d said Ron\nbitterly.\n\nThe Gryffindor common room was very noisy that\nevening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next\nto a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron\u2019s\nCharms homework for them. She would never let\nthem copy (\u201cHow will you learn?\u201d), but by asking her\nto read it through, they got the right answers anyway.\n\nHarry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the\nAges back, to take his mind off his nerves about\ntomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting\nup, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask\nSnape if he could have it.\n\n\u201cBetter you than me,\u201d they said together, but Harry\nhad an idea that Snape wouldn\u2019t refuse if there were\nother teachers listening.\n\nHe made his way down to the staffroom and knocked.\nThere was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing.\n\nPerhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was\nworth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered\ninside \u2014 and a horrible scene met his eyes.\n\nSnape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was\nholding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was\nbloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape\nbandages.\n\nPage | 204 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBlasted thing,\u201d Snape was saying. \u201cHow are you\nsupposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at\nonce?\u201d\n\nHarry tried to shut the door quietly, but \u2014\n\n\u201cPOTTER!\u201d\n\nSnape \u2019s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his\nrobes quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped.\n\n\u201cI just wondered if I could have my book back.\u201d\n\n\u201cGET OUT! OUT!\u201d\n\nHarry left, before Snape could take any more points\nfrom Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs.\n\n\u201cDid you get it?\u201d Ron asked as Harry joined them.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\nIn a low whisper, Harry told them what he\u2019d seen.\n\n\u201cYou know what this means?\u201d he finished\nbreathlessly. \u201cHe tried to get past that three-headed\ndog at Halloween! That\u2019s where he was going when we\nsaw him \u2014 he\u2019s after whatever it\u2019s guarding! And I\u2019d\nbet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a\ndiversion!\u201d\n\nHermione\u2019s eyes were wide.\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 he wouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI know he\u2019s not very\nnice, but he wouldn\u2019t try and steal something\nDumbledore was keeping safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cHonestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints\nor something,\u201d snapped Ron. \u201cI\u2019m with Harry. I\n\n\n\nPage | 205 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nwouldn\u2019t put anything past Snape. But what\u2019s he\nafter? What\u2019s that dog guarding?\u201d\n\nHarry went to bed with his head buzzing with the\nsame question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry\ncouldn\u2019t sleep. He tried to empty his mind \u2014 he\nneeded to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch\nmatch in a few hours \u2014 but the expression on\nSnape\u2019s face when Harry had seen his leg wasn\u2019t easy\nto forget.\n\nThe next morning dawned very bright and cold. The\nGreat Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried\nsausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking\nforward to a good Quidditch match.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to eat some breakfast.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust a bit of toast,\u201d wheedled Hermione.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d\n\nHarry felt terrible. In an hour\u2019s time he\u2019d be walking\nonto the field.\n\n\u201cHarry, you need your strength,\u201d said Seamus\nFinnigan. \u201cSeekers are always the ones who get\nclobbered by the other team.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, Seamus,\u201d said Harry, watching Seamus pile\nketchup on his sausages.\n\nBy eleven o\u2019clock the whole school seemed to be out\nin the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many\nstudents had binoculars. The seats might be raised\nhigh in the air, but it was still difficult to see what\nwas going on sometimes.\n\nPage | 206 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nRon and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean\nthe West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for\nHarry, they had painted a large banner on one of the\nsheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for\nPresident, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had\ndone a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then\nHermione had performed a tricky little charm so that\nthe paint flashed different colors.\n\nMeanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of\nthe team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch\nrobes (Slytherin would be playing in green) .\n\nWood cleared his throat for silence.\n\n\u201cOkay, men,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd women,\u201d said Chaser Angelina Johnson.\n\n\u201cAnd women,\u201d Wood agreed. \u201cThis is it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe big one,\u201d said Fred Weasley.\n\n\u201cThe one we\u2019ve all been waiting for,\u201d said George.\n\n\u201cWe know Oliver\u2019s speech by heart,\u201d Fred told Harry,\n\u201cwe were on the team last year.\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up, you two,\u201d said Wood. \u201cThis is the best team\nGryffindor\u2019s had in years. We\u2019re going to win. I know\nit.\u201d\n\nHe glared at them all as if to say, \u201cOr else.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight. It\u2019s time. Good luck, all of you.\u201d\n\nHarry followed Fred and George out of the locker\nroom and, hoping his knees weren\u2019t going to give way,\nwalked onto the field to loud cheers.\n\nPage | 207 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nMadam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the\nmiddle of the field waiting for the two teams, her\nbroom in her hand.\n\n\u201cNow, I want a nice fair game, all of you,\u201d she said,\nonce they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed\nthat she seemed to be speaking particularly to the\nSlytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a fifth year. Harry\nthought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in\nhim. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering\nbanner high above, flashing Potter for President over\nthe crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.\n\n\u201cMount your brooms, please.\u201d\n\nHarry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.\n\nMadam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.\n\nFifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They\nwere off.\n\n\u201cAnd the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina\nJohnson of Gryffindor \u2014 what an excellent Chaser\nthat girl is, and rather attractive, too \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cJORDAN!\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, Professor.\u201d\n\nThe Weasley twins\u2019 friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the\ncommentary for the match, closely watched by\nProfessor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cAnd she\u2019s really belting along up there, a neat pass\nto Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood\u2019s, last\nyear only a reserve \u2014 back to Johnson and \u2014 no, the\nSlytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain\nMarcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes \u2014 Flint\nPage | 208 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nflying like an eagle up there \u2014 he\u2019s going to sc- no,\nstopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper\nWood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle \u2014 that\u2019s\nChaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive\naround Flint, off up the field and \u2014 OUCH \u2014 that\nmust have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a\nBludger \u2014 Quaffle taken by the Slytherins \u2014 that\u2019s\nAdrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but\nhe\u2019s blocked by a second Bludger \u2014 sent his way by\nFred or George Weasley, can\u2019t tell which \u2014 nice play\nby the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back\nin possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and\noff she goes \u2014 she\u2019s really flying \u2014 dodges a speeding\nBludger \u2014 the goal posts are ahead \u2014 come on, now,\nAngelina \u2014 Keeper Bletchley dives \u2014 misses \u2014\nGRYFFINDORS SCORE!\u201d\n\nGryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and\nmoans from the Slytherins.\n\n\u201cBudge up there, move along.\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d\n\nRon and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid\nenough space to join them.\n\n\u201cBin watchin\u2019 from me hut,\u201d said Hagrid, patting a\nlarge pair of binoculars around his neck, \u201cBut it isn\u2019t\nthe same as bein\u2019 in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch\nyet, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHarry hasn\u2019t had much to do yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cKept outta trouble, though, that\u2019s somethin\u2019,\u201d said\nHagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at\nthe speck that was Harry.\n\n\n\nPage | 209 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nWay up above them, Harry was gliding over the game,\nsquinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was\npart of his and Wood\u2019s game plan.\n\n\u201cKeep out of the way until you catch sight of the\nSnitch,\u201d Wood had said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want you attacked\nbefore you have to be.\u201d\n\nWhen Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple\nof loop-the-loops to let off his feelings. Now he was\nback to staring around for the Snitch. Once he caught\nsight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection\nfrom one of the Weasleys\u2019 wristwatches, and once a\nBludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a\ncannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and\nFred Weasley came chasing after it.\n\n\u201cAll right there, Harry?\u201d he had time to yell, as he\nbeat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint.\n\n\u201cSlytherin in possession,\u201d Lee Jordan was saying,\n\u201cChaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys,\nand Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the \u2014 wait a\nmoment \u2014 was that the Snitch?\u201d\n\nA murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey\ndropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his\nshoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left\near.\n\nHarry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived\ndownward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker\nTerence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they\nhurtled toward the Snitch \u2014 all the Chasers seemed\nto have forgotten what they were supposed to be\ndoing as they hung in midair to watch.\n\n\n\nPage | 210 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nHarry was faster than Higgs \u2014 he could see the little\nround ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead \u2014 he\nput on an extra spurt of speed \u2014\n\nWHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors\nbelow \u2014 Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose,\nand Harry\u2019s broom spun off course, Harry holding on\nfor dear life.\n\n\u201cFoul!\u201d screamed the Gryffindors.\n\nMadam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered\na free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all\nthe confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had\ndisappeared from sight again.\n\nDown in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, \u201cSend\nhim off, ref! Red card!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about, Dean?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cRed card!\u201d said Dean furiously. \u201cIn soccer you get\nshown the red card and you\u2019re out of the game!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this isn\u2019t soccer, Dean,\u201d Ron reminded him.\n\nHagrid, however, was on Dean\u2019s side.\n\n\u201cThey oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked\nHarry outta the air.\u201d\n\nLee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.\n\n\u201cSo \u2014 after that obvious and disgusting bit of\ncheating \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cJordan!\u201d growled Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cI mean, after that open and revolting foul \u2014 \u201d\n\nPage | 211 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cJordan, I\u2019m warning you \u2014 \u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAll right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor\nSeeker, which could happen to anyone, I\u2019m sure, so a\npenalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it\naway, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor\nstill in possession.\u201d\n\nIt was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went\nspinning dangerously past his head, that it happened.\nHis broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a\nsplit second, he thought he was going to fall. He\ngripped the broom tightly with both his hands and\nknees. He\u2019d never felt anything like that.\n\nIt happened again. It was as though the broom was\ntrying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands\ndid not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry\ntried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal posts \u2014\nhe had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out \u2014\nand then he realized that his broom was completely\nout of his control. He couldn\u2019t turn it. He couldn\u2019t\ndirect it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and\nevery now and then making violent swishing\nmovements that almost unseated him.\n\nLee was still commentating.\n\n\u201cSlytherin in possession \u2014 Flint with the Quaffle \u2014\npasses Spinnet \u2014 passes Bell \u2014 hit hard in the face\nby a Bludger, hope it broke his nose \u2014 only joking,\nProfessor \u2014 Slytherins score \u2014 oh no ...\u201d\n\nThe Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have\nnoticed that Harry\u2019s broom was behaving strangely It\nwas carrying him slowly higher, away from the game,\njerking and twitching as it went.\n\n\n\nPage | 212 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDunno what Harry thinks he\u2019s doing,\u201d Hagrid\nmumbled. He stared through his binoculars. \u201cIf I\ndidn\u2019 know better, I\u2019d say he\u2019d lost control of his\nbroom ... but he can\u2019t have. ...\u201d\n\nSuddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over\nthe stands. His broom had started to roll over and\nover, with him only just managing to hold on. Then\nthe whole crowd gasped. Harry\u2019s broom had given a\nwild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling\nfrom it, holding on with only one hand.\n\n\u201cDid something happen to it when Flint blocked him?\u201d\nSeamus whispered.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t have,\u201d Hagrid said, his voice shaking. \u201cCan\u2019t\nnothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful\nDark magic \u2014 no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two\nThousand.\u201d\n\nAt these words, Hermione seized Hagrid \u2019s binoculars,\nbut instead of looking up at Harry, she started\nlooking frantically at the crowd.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d moaned Ron, gray-faced.\n\n\u201cI knew it,\u201d Hermione gasped, \u201cSnape \u2014 look.\u201d\n\nRon grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle\nof the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on\nHarry and was muttering nonstop under his breath.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing something \u2014 jinxing the broom,\u201d said\nHermione.\n\n\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d\n\n\u201cLeave it to me.\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 213 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nBefore Ron could say another word, Hermione had\ndisappeared. Ron turned the binoculars back on\nHarry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost\nimpossible for him to hang on much longer. The\nwhole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the\nWeasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one\nof their brooms, but it was no good \u2014 every time they\ngot near him, the broom would jump higher still. They\ndropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously\nhoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the\nQuaffle and scored five times without anyone\nnoticing.\n\n\u201cCome on, Hermione,\u201d Ron muttered desperately.\n\nHermione had fought her way across to the stand\nwhere Snape stood, and was now racing along the row\nbehind him; she didn\u2019t even stop to say sorry as she\nknocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in\nfront. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled\nout her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen\nwords. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto\nthe hem of Snape \u2019s robes.\n\nIt took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize\nthat he was on fire. A sudden yelp told her she had\ndone her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little jar\nin her pocket, she scrambled back along the row \u2014\nSnape would never know what had happened.\n\nIt was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able\nto clamber back on to his broom.\n\n\u201cNeville, you can look!\u201d Ron said. Neville had been\nsobbing into Hagrid\u2019s jacket for the last five minutes.\n\nHarry was speeding toward the ground when the\ncrowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though\n\n\n\nPage | 214 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nhe was about to be sick \u2014 he hit the field on all fours\n\u2014 coughed \u2014 and something gold fell into his hand.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the Snitch!\u201d he shouted, waving it above his\nhead, and the game ended in complete confusion.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,\u201d Flint was\nstill howling twenty minutes later, but it made no\ndifference \u2014 Harry hadn\u2019t broken any rules and Lee\nJordan was still happily shouting the results \u2014\nGryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy\npoints to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He\nwas being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid\u2019s\nhut, with Ron and Hermione.\n\n\u201cIt was Snape,\u201d Ron was explaining, \u201cHermione and I\nsaw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering,\nhe wouldn\u2019t take his eyes off you.\u201d\n\n\u201cRubbish,\u201d said Hagrid, who hadn\u2019t heard a word of\nwhat had gone on next to him in the stands. \u201cWhy\nwould Snape do somethin\u2019 like that?\u201d\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another,\nwondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the\ntruth.\n\n\u201cI found out something about him,\u201d he told Hagrid.\n\u201cHe tried to get past that three-headed dog on\nHalloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal\nwhatever it\u2019s guarding.\u201d\n\nHagrid dropped the teapot.\n\n\u201cHow do you know about Fluffy?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201c Fluffy ?\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 215 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah \u2014 he\u2019s mine \u2014 bought him off a Greek chappie\nI met in the pub las\u2019 year \u2014 I lent him to Dumbledore\nto guard the \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d said Harry eagerly.\n\n\u201cNow, don\u2019t ask me anymore,\u201d said Hagrid gruffly.\n\u201cThat\u2019s top secret, that is.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Snape\u2019s trying to steal it.\u201d\n\n\u201cRubbish,\u201d said Hagrid again. \u201cSnape\u2019s a Hogwarts\nteacher, he\u2019d do nothin\u2019 of the sort.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo why did he just try and kill Harry?\u201d cried\nHermione.\n\nThe afternoon\u2019s events certainly seemed to have\nchanged her mind about Snape.\n\n\u201cI know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I\u2019ve read all\nabout them! You\u2019ve got to keep eye contact, and\nSnape wasn\u2019t blinking at all, I saw him!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tellin\u2019 yeh, yer wrong!\u201d said Hagrid hotly. \u201cI don\u2019\nknow why Harry\u2019s broom acted like that, but Snape\nwouldn\u2019 try an\u2019 kill a student! Now, listen to me, all\nthree of yeh \u2014 yer meddlin\u2019 in things that don\u2019\nconcern yeh. It\u2019s dangerous. You forget that dog, an\u2019\nyou forget what it\u2019s guardin\u2019, that\u2019s between Professor\nDumbledore an\u2019 Nicolas Flamel \u2014 \u25a0\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d said Harry, \u201cso there\u2019s someone called Nicolas\nFlamel involved, is there?\u201d\n\nHagrid looked furious with himself.\n\n\n\nPage | 216 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE MIRROR OF ERISED\n\nChristmas was coming. One morning in mid-\nDecember, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in\nseveral feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the\nWeasley twins were punished for bewitching several\nsnowballs so that they followed Quirrell around,\nbouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that\nmanaged to battle their way through the stormy sky\nto deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by\nHagrid before they could fly off again.\n\nNo one could wait for the holidays to start. While the\nGryffindor common room and the Great Hall had\nroaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and\na bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms.\nWorst of all were Professor Snape\u2019s classes down in\nthe dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist\nbefore them and they kept as close as possible to\ntheir hot cauldrons.\n\n\u201cI do feel so sorry,\u201d said Draco Malfoy, one Potions\nclass, \u201cfor all those people who have to stay at\n\n\n\nPage | 217 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\nHogwarts for Christmas because they\u2019re not wanted\nat home.\u201d\n\nHe was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and\nGoyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out\npowdered spine of lion-fish, ignored them. Malfoy had\nbeen even more unpleasant than usual since the\nQuidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had\nlost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a\nwide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as\nSeeker next. Then he\u2019d realized that nobody found\nthis funny, because they were all so impressed at the\nway Harry had managed to stay on his bucking\nbroomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone\nback to taunting Harry about having no proper\nfamily.\n\nIt was true that Harry wasn\u2019t going back to Privet\nDrive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come\naround the week before, making a list of students\nwho would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had\nsigned up at once. He didn\u2019t feel sorry for himself at\nall; this would probably be the best Christmas he\u2019d\never had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too,\nbecause Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania\nto visit Charlie.\n\nWhen they left the dungeons at the end of Potions,\nthey found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead.\nTwo enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a\nloud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind\nit.\n\n\u201cHi, Hagrid, want any help?\u201d Ron asked, sticking his\nhead through the branches.\n\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m all right, thanks, Ron.\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 218 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWould you mind moving out of the way?\u201d came\nMalfoy\u2019s cold drawl from behind them. \u201cAre you trying\nto earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be\ngamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I\nsuppose \u2014 that hut of Hagrid\u2019s must seem like a\npalace compared to what your family\u2019s used to.\u201d\n\nRon dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.\n\n\u201cWEASLEY!\u201d\n\nRon let go of the front of Malfoy\u2019s robes.\n\n\u201cHe was provoked, Professor Snape,\u201d said Hagrid,\nsticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree.\n\u201cMalfoy was insultin\u2019 his family.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules,\nHagrid,\u201d said Snape silkily. \u201cFive points from\nGryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn\u2019t more.\nMove along, all of you.\u201d\n\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the\ntree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get him,\u201d said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy\u2019s\nback, \u201cone of these days, I\u2019ll get him \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cI hate them both,\u201d said Harry, \u201cMalfoy and Snape.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, cheer up, it\u2019s nearly Christmas,\u201d said\nHagrid. \u201cTell yeh what, come with me an\u2019 see the\nGreat Hall, looks a treat.\u201d\n\nSo the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off\nto the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and\nProfessor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas\ndecorations.\n\n\n\nPage | 219 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAh, Hagrid, the last tree \u2014 put it in the far corner,\nwould you?\u201d\n\nThe hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and\nmistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than\ntwelve towering Christmas trees stood around the\nroom, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering\nwith hundreds of candles.\n\n\u201cHow many days you got left until yer holidays?\u201d\nHagrid asked.\n\n\u201cJust one,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAnd that reminds me \u2014\nHarry, Ron, we\u2019ve got half an hour before lunch, we\nshould be in the library.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d said Ron, tearing his eyes\naway from Professor Flitwick, who had golden\nbubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing\nthem over the branches of the new tree.\n\n\u201cThe library?\u201d said Hagrid, following them out of the\nhall. \u201cJust before the holidays? Bit keen, aren\u2019t yeh?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, we\u2019re not working,\u201d Harry told him brightly.\n\n\u201cEver since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we\u2019ve been\ntrying to find out who he is.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou what?\u201d Hagrid looked shocked. \u201cListen here \u2014\nI\u2019ve told yeh \u2014 drop it. It\u2019s nothin\u2019 to you what that\ndog\u2019s guardin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that\u2019s\nall,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cUnless you\u2019d like to tell us and save us the trouble?\u201d\nHarry added. \u201cWe must\u2019ve been through hundreds of\nbooks already and we can\u2019t find him anywhere \u2014 just\n\n\n\nPage | 220 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\ngive us a hint \u2014 I know I\u2019ve read his name\nsomewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sayin\u2019 nothin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid flatly.\n\n\u201cJust have to find out for ourselves, then,\u201d said Ron,\nand they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried\noff to the library.\n\nThey had indeed been searching books for Flamel\u2019s\nname ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how\nelse were they going to find out what Snape was\ntrying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to\nknow where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might\nhave done to get himself into a book. He wasn\u2019t in\nGreat Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable\nMagical Names of Our Time ; he was missing, too, from\nImportant Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of\nRecent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of\ncourse, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of\nthousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds\nof narrow rows.\n\nHermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had\ndecided to search while Ron strode off down a row of\nbooks and started pulling them off the shelves at\nrandom. Harry wandered over to the Restricted\nSection. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel\nwasn\u2019t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you\nneeded a specially signed note from one of the\nteachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he\nknew he\u2019d never get one. These were the books\ncontaining powerful Dark Magic never taught at\nHogwarts, and only read by older students studying\nadvanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.\n\n\u201cWhat are you looking for, boy?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Harry.\n\nPage | 221 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nMadam Pince the librarian brandished a feather\nduster at him.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better get out, then. Go on \u2014 out!\u201d\n\nWishing he\u2019d been a bit quicker at thinking up some\nstory, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione\nhad already agreed they\u2019d better not ask Madam\nPince where they could find Flamel. They were sure\nshe\u2019d be able to tell them, but they couldn\u2019t risk\nSnape hearing what they were up to.\n\nHarry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other\ntwo had found anything, but he wasn\u2019t very hopeful.\nThey had been looking for two weeks, after all, but as\nthey only had odd moments between lessons it wasn\u2019t\nsurprising they\u2019d found nothing. What they really\nneeded was a nice long search without Madam Pince\nbreathing down their necks.\n\nFive minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him,\nshaking their heads. They went off to lunch.\n\n\u201cYou will keep looking while I\u2019m away, won\u2019t you?\u201d\nsaid Hermione. \u201cAnd send me an owl if you find\nanything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you could ask your parents if they know who\nFlamel is,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIt\u2019d be safe to ask them.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery safe, as they\u2019re both dentists,\u201d said Hermione.\n\nOnce the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were\nhaving too good a time to think much about Flamel.\nThey had the dormitory to themselves and the\ncommon room was far emptier than usual, so they\nwere able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They\nsat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a\ntoasting fork \u2014 bread, English muffins,\n\nPage | 222 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nmarshmallows \u2014 and plotting ways of getting Malfoy\nexpelled, which were fun to talk about even if they\nwouldn\u2019t work.\n\nRon also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This\nwas exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures\nwere alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in\nbattle. Ron\u2019s set was very old and battered. Like\neverything else he owned, it had once belonged to\nsomeone else in his family \u2014 in this case, his\ngrandfather. However, old chessmen weren\u2019t a\ndrawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had\ntrouble getting them to do what he wanted.\n\nHarry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had\nlent him, and they didn\u2019t trust him at all. He wasn\u2019t a\nvery good player yet and they kept shouting different\nbits of advice at him, which was confusing. \u201cDon\u2019t\nsend me there, can\u2019t you see his knight? Send him, we\ncan afford to lose him.\u201d\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward\nto the next day for the food and the fun, but not\nexpecting any presents at all. When he woke early in\nthe morning, however, the first thing he saw was a\nsmall pile of packages at the foot of his bed.\n\n\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d said Ron sleepily as Harry\nscrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.\n\n\u201cYou, too,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWill you look at this? I\u2019ve got\nsome presents!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you expect, turnips?\u201d said Ron, turning to\nhis own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry\u2019s.\n\nHarry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in\nthick brown paper and scrawled across it was To\nHarry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden\n\nPage | 223 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nflute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry\nblew it \u2014 it sounded a bit like an owl.\n\nA second, very small parcel contained a note.\n\nWe received your message and enclose your Christmas\npresent. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped\nto the note was a fifty-pence piece.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s friendly,\u201d said Harry.\n\nRon was fascinated by the fifty pence.\n\n\u201c Weird \u201d he said, \u201cWhat a shape! This is money?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can keep it,\u201d said Harry, laughing at how\npleased Ron was. \u201cHagrid and my aunt and uncle \u2014\nso who sent these?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I know who that one\u2019s from,\u201d said Ron,\nturning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy\nparcel. \u201cMy mom. I told her you didn\u2019t expect any\npresents and \u2014 oh, no,\u201d he groaned, \u201cshe\u2019s made you\na Weasley sweater.\u201d\n\nHarry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-\nknitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of\nhomemade fudge.\n\n\u201cEvery year she makes us a sweater,\u201d said Ron,\nunwrapping his own, \u201cand mine\u2019s always maroon.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really nice of her,\u201d said Harry, trying the\nfudge, which was very tasty.\n\nHis next present also contained candy \u2014 a large box\nof Chocolate Frogs from Hermione.\n\n\n\nPage | 224 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nThis only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt\nit. It was very light. He unwrapped it.\n\nSomething fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the\nfloor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of those,\u201d he said in a hushed voice,\ndropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he\u2019d gotten\nfrom Hermione. \u201cIf that\u2019s what I think it is \u2014 they\u2019re\nreally rare, and really valuable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\nHarry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It\nwas strange to the touch, like water woven into\nmaterial.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an Invisibility Cloak,\u201d said Ron, a look of awe on\nhis face. \u201cI\u2019m sure it is \u2014 try it on.\u201d\n\nHarry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron\ngave a yell.\n\n\u201cIt is! Look down!\u201d\n\nHarry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He\ndashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection\nlooked back at him, just his head suspended in\nmidair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the\ncloak over his head and his reflection vanished\ncompletely.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a note!\u201d said Ron suddenly. \u201cA note fell out of\nit!\u201d\n\n\n\nHarry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter.\nWritten in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen\nbefore were the following words:\n\n\n\nPage | 225 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nYour father left this in my possession before he died. It\nis time it was returned to you.\n\nUse it well.\n\nA Very Merry Christmas to you.\n\nThere was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron\nwas admiring the cloak.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d give anuthinq for one of these,\u201d he said. \u201cAnuthinq.\nWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had\nsent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his\nfather?\n\nBefore he could say or think anything else, the\ndormitory door was flung open and Fred and George\nWeasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly\nout of sight. He didn\u2019t feel like sharing it with anyone\nelse yet.\n\n\u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, look \u2014 Harry\u2019s got a Weasley sweater, too!\u201d\n\nFred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one\nwith a large yellow F on it, the other a G.\n\n\u201cHarry\u2019s is better than ours, though,\u201d said Fred,\nholding up Harry\u2019s sweater. \u201cShe obviously makes\nmore of an effort if you\u2019re not family.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you wearing yours, Ron?\u201d George\ndemanded. \u201cCome on, get it on, they\u2019re lovely and\nwarm.\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 226 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI hate maroon,\u201d Ron moaned halfheartedly as he\npulled it over his head.\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t got a letter on yours,\u201d George observed.\n\n\u201cI suppose she thinks you don\u2019t forget your name. But\nwe\u2019re not stupid \u2014 we know we\u2019re called Gred and\nForge.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all this noise?\u201d\n\nPercy Weasley stuck his head through the door,\nlooking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway\nthrough unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a\nlumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized.\n\n\u201cP for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we\u2019re all\nwearing ours, even Harry got one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 don\u2019t \u2014 want \u2014 \u201d said Percy thickly, as the twins\nforced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses\naskew.\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re not sitting with the prefects today,\neither,\u201d said George. \u201cChristmas is a time for family.\u201d\n\nThey frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms\npinned to his side by his sweater.\n\nHarry had never in all his life had such a Christmas\ndinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of\nroast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas;\ntureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich\ngravy and cranberry sauce \u2014 and stacks of wizard\ncrackers every few feet along the table. These\nfantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble\nMuggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their\nlittle plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside.\nHarry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn\u2019t\njust bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and\nPage | 227 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nengulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from\nthe inside exploded a rear admiral\u2019s hat and several\nlive, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore\nhad swapped his pointed wizard\u2019s hat for a flowered\nbonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor\nFlitwick had just read him.\n\nFlaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey.\nPercy nearly broke his teeth on a silver Sickle\nembedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting\nredder and redder in the face as he called for more\nwine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the\ncheek, who, to Harry\u2019s amazement, giggled and\nblushed, her top hat lopsided.\n\nWhen Harry finally left the table, he was laden down\nwith a stack of things out of the crackers, including a\npack of non-explodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-\nYour-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess\nset. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a\nnasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs.\nNorris\u2019s Christmas dinner.\n\nHarry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon\nhaving a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then,\ncold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the\nfire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry\nbroke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to\nRon. He suspected he wouldn\u2019t have lost so badly if\nPercy hadn\u2019t tried to help him so much.\n\nAfter a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle,\nand Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy\nto do much before bed except sit and watch Percy\nchase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower\nbecause they\u2019d stolen his prefect badge.\n\nIt had been Harry\u2019s best Christmas day ever. Yet\nsomething had been nagging at the back of his mind\n\nPage | 228 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nall day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to\nthink about it: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had\nsent it.\n\nRon, full of turkey and cake and with nothing\nmysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon\nas he\u2019d drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry\nleaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the\ncloak out from under it.\n\nHis father\u2019s ... this had been his father\u2019s. He let the\nmaterial flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light\nas air. Use it well, the note had said.\n\nHe had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and\nwrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at\nhis legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a\nvery funny feeling.\n\nUse it well.\n\nSuddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of\nHogwarts was open to him in this cloak. Excitement\nflooded through him as he stood there in the dark\nand silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere,\nand Filch would never know.\n\nRon grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him?\nSomething held him back \u2014 his father\u2019s cloak \u2014 he\nfelt that this time \u2014 the first time \u2014 he wanted to use\nit alone.\n\nHe crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across\nthe common room, and climbed through the portrait\nhole.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said\nnothing. He walked quickly down the corridor.\n\n\n\nPage | 229 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nWhere should he go? He stopped, his heart racing,\nand thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted\nSection in the library. He\u2019d be able to read as long as\nhe liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel\nwas. He set off, drawing the Invisibility Cloak tight\naround him as he walked.\n\nThe library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a\nlamp to see his way along the rows of books. The\nlamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and\neven though Harry could feel his arm supporting it,\nthe sight gave him the creeps.\n\nThe Restricted Section was right at the back of the\nlibrary. Stepping carefully over the rope that\nseparated these books from the rest of the library, he\nheld up his lamp to read the titles.\n\nThey didn\u2019t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold\nletters spelled words in languages Harry couldn\u2019t\nunderstand. Some had no title at all. One book had a\ndark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The\nhairs on the back of Harry\u2019s neck prickled. Maybe he\nwas imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint\nwhispering was coming from the books, as though\nthey knew someone was there who shouldn\u2019t be.\n\nHe had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down\ncarefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom\nshelf for an interesting-looking book. A large black\nand silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out\nwith difficulty, because it was very heavy, and,\nbalancing it on his knee, let it fall open.\n\nA piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence \u2014\nthe book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but\nthe shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken,\nearsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked\nover his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he\nPage | 230 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nheard footsteps coming down the corridor outside \u2014\nstuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran\nfor it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch\u2019s pale,\nwild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry\nslipped under Filch\u2019s outstretched arm and streaked\noff up the corridor, the book\u2019s shrieks still ringing in\nhis ears.\n\nHe came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of\narmor. He had been so busy getting away from the\nlibrary, he hadn\u2019t paid attention to where he was\ngoing. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn\u2019t\nrecognize where he was at all. There was a suit of\narmor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be\nfive floors above there.\n\n\u201cYou asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if\nanyone was wandering around at night, and\nsomebody\u2019s been in the library \u2014 Restricted Section.\u201d\n\nHarry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he\nwas, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft,\ngreasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it\nwas Snape who replied, \u201cThe Restricted Section? Well,\nthey can\u2019t be far, we\u2019ll catch them.\u201d\n\nHarry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape\ncame around the corner ahead. They couldn\u2019t see\nhim, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if\nthey came much nearer they\u2019d knock right into him \u2014\nthe cloak didn\u2019t stop him from being solid.\n\nHe backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood\najar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed\nthrough it, holding his breath, trying not to move it,\nand to his relief he managed to get inside the room\nwithout their noticing anything. They walked straight\npast, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing\ndeeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That\nPage | 231 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nhad been close, very close. It was a few seconds\nbefore he noticed anything about the room he had\nhidden in.\n\n\n\nIt looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes\nof desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and\nthere was an upturned wastepaper basket \u2014 but\npropped against the wall facing him was something\nthat didn\u2019t look as if it belonged there, something that\nlooked as if someone had just put it there to keep it\nout of the way.\n\nIt was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling,\nwith an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed\nfeet. There was an inscription carved around the top:\nErised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.\n\nHis panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch\nand Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror,\nwanting to look at himself but see no reflection again.\nHe stepped in front of it.\n\nHe had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself\nfrom screaming. He whirled around. His heart was\npounding far more furiously than when the book had\nscreamed \u2014 for he had seen not only himself in the\nmirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right\nbehind him.\n\nBut the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he\nturned slowly back to the mirror.\n\nThere he was, reflected in it, white and scared-\nlooking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least\nten others. Harry looked over his shoulder \u2014 but still,\nno one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was\nhe in fact in a room full of invisible people and this\nmirrors trick was that it reflected them, invisible or\nnot?\n\nPage | 232 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nHe looked in the mirror again. A woman standing\nright behind his reflection was smiling at him and\nwaving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind\nhim. If she was really there, he\u2019d touch her, their\nreflections were so close together, but he felt only air\n\u2014 she and the others existed only in the mirror.\n\nShe was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair\nand her eyes \u2014 her eyes are just like mine, Harry\nthought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright\ngreen \u2014 exactly the same shape, but then he noticed\nthat she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same\ntime. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next\nto her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and\nhis hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just\nas Harry\u2019s did.\n\nHarry was so close to the mirror now that his nose\nwas nearly touching that of his reflection.\n\n\u201cMom?\u201d he whispered. \u201cDad?\u201d\n\nThey just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry\nlooked into the faces of the other people in the mirror,\nand saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses\nlike his, even a little old man who looked as though\nhe had Harry\u2019s knobbly knees \u2014 Harry was looking at\nhis family, for the first time in his life.\n\nThe Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared\nhungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against\nthe glass as though he was hoping to fall right\nthrough it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of\nache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.\n\nHow long he stood there, he didn\u2019t know. The\nreflections did not fade and he looked and looked\nuntil a distant noise brought him back to his senses.\nHe couldn\u2019t stay here, he had to find his way back to\n\nPage | 233 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nbed. He tore his eyes away from his mother\u2019s face,\nwhispered, \u201cI\u2019ll come back,\u201d and hurried from the\nroom.\n\n\u201cYou could have woken me up,\u201d said Ron, crossly.\n\n\u201cYou can come tonight, I\u2019m going back, I want to show\nyou the mirror.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see your mom and dad,\u201d Ron said eagerly.\n\n\u201cAnd I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys,\nyou\u2019ll be able to show me your other brothers and\neveryone.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can see them any old time,\u201d said Ron. \u201cJust\ncome round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe\nit only shows dead people. Shame about not finding\nFlamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why\naren\u2019t you eating anything?\u201d\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t eat. He had seen his parents and\nwould be seeing them again tonight. He had almost\nforgotten about Flamel. It didn\u2019t seem very important\nanymore. Who cared what the three-headed dog was\nguarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really?\n\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou look odd.\u201d\n\nWhat Harry feared most was that he might not be\nable to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered\nin the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly\nthe next night. They tried retracing Harry\u2019s route from\nthe library, wandering around the dark passageways\nfor nearly an hour.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m freezing,\u201d said Ron. \u201cLet\u2019s forget it and go back.\u201d\n\n\u201cIVo!\u201d Harry hissed. \u201cI know it\u2019s here somewhere.\u201d\n\nPage | 234 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nThey passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the\nopposite direction, but saw no one else. Just as Ron\nstarted moaning that his feet were dead with cold,\nHarry spotted the suit of armor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s here \u2014 just here \u2014 yes!\u201d\n\nThey pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak\nfrom around his shoulders and ran to the mirror.\n\nThere they were. His mother and father beamed at the\nsight of him.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d Harry whispered.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook! Look at them all ... there are loads of them. ...\u201d\n\u201cI can only see you.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook in it properly, go on, stand where I am.\u201d\n\nHarry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the\nmirror, he couldn\u2019t see his family anymore, just Ron\nin his paisley pajamas.\n\nRon, though, was staring transfixed at his image.\n\u201cLook at me!\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cCan you see all your family standing around you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 I\u2019m alone \u2014 but I\u2019m different \u2014 I look older \u2014\nand I\u2019m Head Boy!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 235 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI am \u2014 I\u2019m wearing the badge like Bill used to \u2014 and\nI\u2019m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup \u2014\nI\u2019m Quidditch captain, too!\u201d\n\nRon tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to\nlook excitedly at Harry.\n\n\u201cDo you think this mirror shows the future?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can it? All my family are dead \u2014 let me have\nanother look \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cYou had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit\nmore time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re only holding the Quidditch Cup, what\u2019s\ninteresting about that? I want to see my parents.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t push me \u2014 \u201d\n\nA sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to\ntheir discussion. They hadn\u2019t realized how loudly they\nhad been talking.\n\n\u201cQuick!\u201d\n\nRon threw the cloak back over them as the luminous\neyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and\nHarry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing\n\u2014 did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an\nage, she turned and left.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t safe \u2014 she might have gone for Filch, I bet\nshe heard us. Come on.\u201d\n\nAnd Ron pulled Harry out of the room.\n\nThe snow still hadn\u2019t melted the next morning.\n\n\n\nPage | 236 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWant to play chess, Harry?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go down and visit Hagrid?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo ... you go ...\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking about, Harry, that\nmirror. Don\u2019t go back tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno, I\u2019ve just got a bad feeling about it \u2014 and\nanyway, you\u2019ve had too many close shaves already.\nFilch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around.\nSo what if they can\u2019t see you? What if they walk into\nyou? What if you knock something over?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sound like Hermione.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m serious, Harry, don\u2019t go.\u201d\n\nBut Harry only had one thought in his head, which\nwas to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn\u2019t\ngoing to stop him.\n\nThat third night he found his way more quickly than\nbefore. He was walking so fast he knew he was\nmaking more noise than was wise, but he didn\u2019t meet\nanyone.\n\nAnd there were his mother and father smiling at him\nagain, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily.\nHarry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the\nmirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying\nhere all night with his family. Nothing at all.\n\nExcept \u2014\n\nPage | 237 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo \u2014 back again, Harry?\u201d\n\nHarry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He\nlooked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the\nwall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry\nmust have walked straight past him, so desperate to\nget to the mirror he hadn\u2019t noticed him.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 I didn\u2019t see you, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cStrange how nearsighted being invisible can make\nyou,\u201d said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see\nthat he was smiling.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on\nthe floor with Harry, \u201cyou, like hundreds before you,\nhave discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was called that, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I expect you\u2019ve realized by now what it does?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt \u2014 well \u2014 it shows me my family \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you know \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need a cloak to become invisible,\u201d said\nDumbledore gently. \u201cNow, can you think what the\nMirror of Erised shows us all?\u201d\n\nHarry shook his head.\n\n\u201cLet me explain. The happiest man on earth would be\nable to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror,\nthat is, he would look into it and see himself exactly\nas he is. Does that help?\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 238 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nHarry thought. Then he said slowly, \u201cIt shows us\nwhat we want ... whatever we want ...\u201d\n\n\u201cYes and no,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly. \u201cIt shows us\nnothing more or less than the deepest, most\ndesperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never\nknown your family, see them standing around you.\nRonald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed\nby his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best\nof all of them. However, this mirror will give us\nneither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away\nbefore it, entranced by what they have seen, or been\ndriven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or\neven possible.\n\n\u201cThe Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow,\nHarry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If\nyou ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It\ndoes not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live,\nremember that. Now, why don\u2019t you put that\nadmirable cloak back on and get off to bed?\u201d\n\nHarry stood up.\n\n\u201cSir \u2014 Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you\nsomething?\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously, you\u2019ve just done so,\u201d Dumbledore smiled.\n\u201cYou may ask me one more thing, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you see when you look in the mirror?\u201d\n\n\u201cI? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\u201d\n\nHarry stared.\n\n\u201cOne can never have enough socks,\u201d said\nDumbledore. \u201cAnother Christmas has come and gone\n\n\n\nPage | 239 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nand I didn\u2019t get a single pair. People will insist on\ngiving me books.\u201d\n\nIt was only when he was back in bed that it struck\nHarry that Dumbledore might not have been quite\ntruthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved\nScabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal\nquestion.\n\n\n\nPage | 240 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNICHOLAS FLAMBL\n\nDumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking\nfor the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the\nChristmas holidays the Invisibility Cloak stayed\nfolded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he\ncould forget what he\u2019d seen in the mirror as easily,\nbut he couldn\u2019t. He started having nightmares. Over\nand over again he dreamed about his parents\ndisappearing in a flash of green light, while a high\nvoice cackled with laughter.\n\n\u201cYou see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could\ndrive you mad,\u201d said Ron, when Harry told him about\nthese dreams.\n\nHermione, who came back the day before term\nstarted, took a different view of things. She was torn\nbetween horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed,\nroaming the school three nights in a row (\u201cIf Filch had\ncaught you!\u201d), and disappointment that he hadn\u2019t at\nleast found out who Nicolas Flamel was.\n\n\n\nPage | 241 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\nThey had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel\nin a library book, even though Harry was still sure\nhe\u2019d read the name somewhere. Once term had\nstarted, they were back to skimming through books\nfor ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even\nless time than the other two, because Quidditch\npractice had started again.\n\nWood was working the team harder than ever. Even\nthe endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn\u2019t\ndampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that\nWood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on\nWood\u2019s side. If they won their next match, against\nHufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the\nHouse Championship for the first time in seven years.\nQuite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he\nhad fewer nightmares when he was tired out after\ntraining.\n\nThen, during one particularly wet and muddy practice\nsession, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He\u2019d\njust gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept\ndive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off\ntheir brooms.\n\n\u201cWill you stop messing around!\u201d he yelled. \u201cThat\u2019s\nexactly the sort of thing that\u2019ll lose us the match!\nSnape\u2019s refereeing this time, and he\u2019ll be looking for\nany excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!\u201d\n\nGeorge Weasley really did fall off his broom at these\nwords.\n\n\u201c Snape\u2019s refereeing?\u201d he spluttered through a\nmouthful of mud. \u201cWhen\u2019s he ever refereed a\nQuidditch match? He\u2019s not going to be fair if we might\novertake Slytherin.\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 242 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nThe rest of the team landed next to George to\ncomplain, too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault,\u201d said Wood. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to make\nsure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn\u2019t got an\nexcuse to pick on us.\u201d\n\nWhich was all very well, thought Harry, but he had\nanother reason for not wanting Snape near him while\nhe was playing Quidditch. ...\n\nThe rest of the team hung back to talk to one another\nas usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed\nstraight back to the Gryffindor common room, where\nhe found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was\nthe only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry\nand Ron thought was very good for her.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me for a moment,\u201d said Ron when Harry\nsat down next to him, \u201cI need to concern\u201d He caught\nsight of Harry\u2019s face. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\n\nYou look terrible.\u201d\n\nSpeaking quietly so that no one else would hear,\n\nHarry told the other two about Snape \u2019s sudden,\nsinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t play,\u201d said Hermione at once.\n\n\u201cSay you\u2019re ill,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cPretend to break your leg,\u201d Hermione suggested.\n\n\u201c Really break your leg,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a reserve Seeker. If I\nback out, Gryffindor can\u2019t play at all.\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 243 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nAt that moment Neville toppled into the common\nroom. How he had managed to climb through the\nportrait hole was anyone\u2019s guess, because his legs\nhad been stuck together with what they recognized at\nonce as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to\nbunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower.\n\nEveryone fell over laughing except Hermione, who\nleapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville\u2019s\nlegs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling.\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Hermione asked him, leading him\nover to sit with Harry and Ron.\n\n\u201cMalfoy,\u201d said Neville shakily. \u201cI met him outside the\nlibrary. He said he\u2019d been looking for someone to\npractice that on.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo to Professor McGonagall!\u201d Hermione urged\nNeville. \u201cReport him!\u201d\n\nNeville shook his head.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want more trouble,\u201d he mumbled.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to stand up to him, Neville!\u201d said Ron.\n\u201cHe\u2019s used to walking all over people, but that\u2019s no\nreason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to tell me I\u2019m not brave enough to be\nin Gryffindor, Malfoy\u2019s already done that,\u201d Neville\nchoked out.\n\nHarry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a\nChocolate Frog, the very last one from the box\nHermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to\nNeville, who looked as though he might cry.\n\n\n\nPage | 244 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re worth twelve of Malfoy,\u201d Harry said. \u201cThe\nSorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn\u2019t it? And\nwhere\u2019s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.\u201d\n\nNeville\u2019s lips twitched in a weak smile as he\nunwrapped the frog.\n\n\u201cThanks, Harry ... I think I\u2019ll go to bed. ... D\u2019you want\nthe card, you collect them, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nAs Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous\nWizard card.\n\n\u201cDumbledore again,\u201d he said, \u201cHe was the first one I\never \u2014 \u201d\n\nHe gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he\nlooked up at Ron and Hermione.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve found him\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve found Flamel! I\ntold you I\u2019d read the name somewhere before, I read it\non the train coming here \u2014 listen to this:\n\n\u2018Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of\nthe Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the\ndiscovery of the twelve uses of dragon\u2019s blood, and his\nwork on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel\u2019V\u2019\n\nHermione jumped to her feet. She hadn\u2019t looked so\nexcited since they\u2019d gotten back the marks for their\nvery first piece of homework.\n\n\u201cStay there!\u201d she said, and she sprinted up the stairs\nto the girls\u2019 dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had\ntime to exchange mystified looks before she was\ndashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.\n\n\u201cI never thought to look in here!\u201d she whispered\nexcitedly. \u201cI got this out of the library weeks ago for a\nbit of light reading.\u201d\n\nPage | 245 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLight?\u201d said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet\nuntil she\u2019d looked something up, and started flicking\nfrantically through the pages, muttering to herself.\n\nAt last she found what she was looking for.\n\n\u201cI knew it! I knew it!\u201d\n\n\u201cAre we allowed to speak yet?\u201d said Ron grumpily.\nHermione ignored him.\n\n\u201cNicolas Flamel,\u201d she whispered dramatically, \u201cis the\nonly known maker of the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone\u201d\n\nThis didn\u2019t have quite the effect she\u2019d expected.\n\n\u201cThe what?\u201d said Harry and Ron.\n\n\u201cOh, honestly , don\u2019t you two read? Look \u2014 read that,\nthere.\u201d\n\nShe pushed the book toward them, and Harry and\nRon read:\n\nThe ancient study of alchemy is concerned with\nmaking the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone, a legendary substance\nwith astonishing powers. The Stone will transform\nany metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of\nLife, which will make the drinker immortal.\n\nThere have been many reports of the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone\nover the centuries, but the only Stone currently in\nexistence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted\nalchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated\nhis six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year,\nenjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle\n(six hundred and fifty-eight).\n\n\n\nPage | 246 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had\nfinished. \u201cThe dog must be guarding Flamel\u2019s\nSorcerer\u2019s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep\nit safe for him, because they\u2019re friends and he knew\nsomeone was after it, that\u2019s why he wanted the Stone\nmoved out of Gringotts!\u201d\n\n\u201cA stone that makes gold and stops you from ever\ndying!\u201d said Harry. \u201cNo wonder Snape\u2019s after it!\n\nAnyone would want it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd no wonder we couldn\u2019t find Flamel in that Study\nof Recent Developments in Wizardry,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHe\u2019s\nnot exactly recent if he\u2019s six hundred and sixty-five, is\nhe?\u201d\n\nThe next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts,\nwhile copying down different ways of treating werewolf\nbites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they\u2019d\ndo with a Sorcerer\u2019s Stone if they had one. It wasn\u2019t\nuntil Ron said he\u2019d buy his own Quidditch team that\nHarry remembered about Snape and the coming\nmatch.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to play,\u201d he told Ron and Hermione. \u201cIf I\ndon\u2019t, all the Slytherins will think I\u2019m just too scared\nto face Snape. I\u2019ll show them ... it\u2019ll really wipe the\nsmiles off their faces if we win.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as long as we\u2019re not wiping you off the field,\u201d\nsaid Hermione.\n\nAs the match drew nearer, however, Harry became\nmore and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and\nHermione. The rest of the team wasn\u2019t too calm,\neither. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the House\nChampionship was wonderful, no one had done it for\nseven years, but would they be allowed to, with such\na biased referee?\n\nPage | 247 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nHarry didn\u2019t know whether he was imagining it or not,\nbut he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever\nhe went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape\nwas following him, trying to catch him on his own.\nPotions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly\ntorture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape\npossibly know they\u2019d found out about the Sorcerer\u2019s\nStone? Harry didn\u2019t see how he could \u2014 yet he\nsometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could\nread minds.\n\nHarry knew, when they wished him good luck\noutside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron\nand Hermione were wondering whether they\u2019d ever\nsee him alive again. This wasn\u2019t what you\u2019d call\ncomforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood\u2019s pep\ntalk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked\nup his Nimbus Two Thousand.\n\nRon and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in\nthe stands next to Neville, who couldn\u2019t understand\nwhy they looked so grim and worried, or why they had\nboth brought their wands to the match. Little did\nHarry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly\npracticing the Leg-Locker Curse. They\u2019d gotten the\nidea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready\nto use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to\nhurt Harry.\n\n\u201cNow, don\u2019t forget, it\u2019s Locomotor Mortis,\u201d Hermione\nmuttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Ron snapped. \u201cDon\u2019t nag.\u201d\n\nBack in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry\naside.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever\nneed an early capture of the Snitch it\u2019s now. Finish\n\nPage | 248 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nthe game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too\nmuch.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole school\u2019s out there!\u201d said Fred Weasley,\npeering out of the door. \u201cEven \u2014 blimey \u2014\nDumbledore\u2019s come to watch!\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart did a somersault.\n\n\u201cDumbledore?\u201d he said, dashing to the door to make\nsure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that\nsilver beard.\n\nHarry could have laughed out loud with relief. He was\nsafe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare\nto try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching.\n\nPerhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as\nthe teams marched onto the field, something that Ron\nnoticed, too.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen Snape look so mean,\u201d he told\nHermione. \u201cLook \u2014 they\u2019re off. Ouch!\u201d\n\nSomeone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It\nwas Malfoy.\n\n\u201cOh, sorry, Weasley, didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d\n\nMalfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.\n\n\u201cWonder how long Potter\u2019s going to stay on his broom\nthis time? Anyone want a bet? What about you,\nWeasley?\u201d\n\nRon didn\u2019t answer; Snape had just awarded\nHufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit\na Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers\ncrossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry,\n\nPage | 249 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nwho was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the\nSnitch.\n\n\u201cYou know how I think they choose people for the\nGryffindor team?\u201d said Malfoy loudly a few minutes\nlater, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty\nfor no reason at all. \u201cIt\u2019s people they feel sorry for.\n\nSee, there\u2019s Potter, who\u2019s got no parents, then there\u2019s\nthe Weasleys, who\u2019ve got no money \u2014 you should be\non the team, Longbottom, you\u2019ve got no brains.\u201d\n\nNeville went bright red but turned in his seat to face\nMalfoy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,\u201d he stammered.\n\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but\nRon, still not daring to take his eyes from the game,\nsaid, \u201cYou tell him, Neville.\u201d\n\n\u201cLongbottom, if brains were gold you\u2019d be poorer than\nWeasley, and that\u2019s saying something.\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s nerves were already stretched to the breaking\npoint with anxiety about Harry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m warning you, Malfoy \u2014 one more word \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cRon!\u201d said Hermione suddenly, \u201cHarry \u2014 !\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Where?\u201d\n\nHarry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive,\nwhich drew gasps and cheers from the crowd.\nHermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth,\nas Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in luck, Weasley, Potter\u2019s obviously spotted\nsome money on the ground!\u201d said Malfoy.\n\nPage | 250 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nRon snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was\nhappening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to\nthe ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the\nback of his seat to help.\n\n\u201cCome on, Harry!\u201d Hermione screamed, leaping onto\nher seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape \u2014\nshe didn\u2019t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around\nunder her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from\nthe whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.\n\nUp in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in\ntime to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing\nhim by inches \u2014 the next second, Harry had pulled\nout of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch\nclasped in his hand.\n\nThe stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one\ncould ever remember the Snitch being caught so\nquickly.\n\n\u201cRon! Ron! Where are you? The game\u2019s over! Harry\u2019s\nwon! We\u2019ve won! Gryffindor is in the lead!\u201d shrieked\nHermione, dancing up and down on her seat and\nhugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.\n\nHarry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground.\nHe couldn\u2019t believe it. He\u2019d done it \u2014 the game was\nover; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors\ncame spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land\nnearby, white-faced and tight-lipped \u2014 then Harry felt\na hand on his shoulder and looked up into\nDumbledore\u2019s smiling face.\n\n\u201cWell done,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly, so that only\nHarry could hear. \u201cNice to see you haven\u2019t been\nbrooding about that mirror . . . been keeping busy . . .\nexcellent ...\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 251 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nSnape spat bitterly on the ground.\n\n\n\nJc Jc Jc\n\n\n\nHarry left the locker room alone some time later, to\ntake his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the\nbroomshed. He couldn\u2019t ever remember feeling\nhappier. He\u2019d really done something to be proud of\nnow \u2014 no one could say he was just a famous name\nany more. The evening air had never smelled so\nsweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the\nlast hour in his head, which was a happy blur:\nGryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders;\nRon and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and\ndown, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.\n\nHarry had reached the shed. He leaned against the\nwooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its\nwindows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in\nthe lead. He\u2019d done it, he\u2019d shown Snape. ...\n\nAnd speaking of Snape . . .\n\nA hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of\nthe castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked\nas fast as possible toward the forbidden forest.\nHarry\u2019s victory faded from his mind as he watched.\nHe recognized the figure\u2019s prowling walk. Snape,\nsneaking into the forest while everyone else was at\ndinner \u2014 what was going on?\n\nHarry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand\nand took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw\nSnape enter the forest at a run. He followed.\n\nThe trees were so thick he couldn\u2019t see where Snape\nhad gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower,\nbrushing the top branches of trees until he heard\n\n\n\nPage | 252 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nvoices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly\nin a towering beech tree.\n\nHe climbed carefully along one of the branches,\nholding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through\nthe leaves.\n\nBelow, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he\nwasn\u2019t alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn\u2019t\nmake out the look on his face, but he was stuttering\nworse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they\nwere saying.\n\n"... d-don\u2019t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of\nall p-places, Severus ...\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I thought we\u2019d keep this private,\u201d said Snape, his\nvoice icy. \u201cStudents aren\u2019t supposed to know about\nthe Sorcerer\u2019s Stone, after all.\u201d\n\nHarry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling\nsomething. Snape interrupted him.\n\n\u201cHave you found out how to get past that beast of\nHagrid\u2019s yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cB-b-but Severus, I \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,\u201d said\nSnape, taking a step toward him.\n\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know what you \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cYou know perfectly well what I mean.\u201d\n\nAn owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the\ntree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say,\n\n\u201c \u2014 your little bit of hocus-pocus. I\u2019m waiting.\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 253 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cB-but I d-d-don\u2019t \u2014 \u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Snape cut in. \u201cWell have another little\nchat soon, when you\u2019ve had time to think things over\nand decided where your loyalties lie.\u201d\n\nHe threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the\nclearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see\nQuirrell, standing quite still as though he was\npetrified.\n\n\n\nJc Jc Jc\n\n\n\n\u201cHarry, where have you been?\u201d Hermione squeaked.\n\n\u201cWe won! You won! We won!\u201d shouted Ron, thumping\nHarry on the back. \u201cAnd I gave Malfoy a black eye,\nand Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-\nhanded! He\u2019s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says\nhe\u2019ll be all right \u2014 talk about showing Slytherin!\nEveryone\u2019s waiting for you in the common room, we\u2019re\nhaving a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and\nstuff from the kitchens.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind that now,\u201d said Harry breathlessly. \u201cLet\u2019s\nfind an empty room, you wait \u2019til you hear this. ...\u201d\n\nHe made sure Peeves wasn\u2019t inside before shutting\nthe door behind them, then he told them what he\u2019d\nseen and heard.\n\n\u201cSo we were right, it is the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone, and\nSnape\u2019s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He\nasked if he knew how to get past Fluffy \u2014 and he said\nsomething about Quirrell\u2019s \u2018hocus-pocus\u2019 \u2014 I reckon\nthere are other things guarding the stone apart from\nFluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell\n\n\n\nPage | 254 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nwould have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that\nSnape needs to break through \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cSo you mean the Stone\u2019s only safe as long as Quirrell\nstands up to Snape?\u201d said Hermione in alarm.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be gone by next Tuesday,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\n\nPage | 255 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNORBERT THE NORWEGIAN\nRIDGEBACK\n\nQuirrell, however, must have been braver than they\u2019d\nthought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be\ngetting paler and thinner, but it didn\u2019t look as though\nhe\u2019d cracked yet.\n\nEvery time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry,\nRon, and Hermione would press their ears to the door\nto check that Fluffy was still growling inside. Snape\nwas sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which\nsurely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever\nHarry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an\nencouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling\npeople off for laughing at Quirrell\u2019s stutter.\n\nHermione, however, had more on her mind than the\nSorcerer\u2019s Stone. She had started drawing up study\nschedules and color-coding all her notes. Harry and\nRon wouldn\u2019t have minded, but she kept nagging\nthem to do the same.\n\n\n\nPage | 256 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\u201cHermione, the exams are ages away.\u201d\n\n\u201cTen weeks,\u201d Hermione snapped. \u201cThat\u2019s not ages,\nthat\u2019s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not six hundred years old,\u201d Ron reminded\nher. \u201cAnyway, what are you studying for, you already\nknow it all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize\nwe need to pass these exams to get into the second\nyear? They\u2019re very important, I should have started\nstudying a month ago, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into\nme.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking\nalong the same lines as Hermione. They piled so\nmuch homework on them that the Easter holidays\nweren\u2019t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It\nwas hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting\nthe twelve uses of dragon\u2019s blood or practicing wand\nmovements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron\nspent most of their free time in the library with her,\ntrying to get through all their extra work.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never remember this,\u201d Ron burst out one\nafternoon, throwing down his quill and looking\nlongingly out of the library window. It was the first\nreally fine day they\u2019d had in months. The sky was a\nclear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in\nthe air of summer coming.\n\nHarry, who was looking up \u201cDittany\u201d in One Thousand\nMagical Herbs and Fungi, didn\u2019t look up until he\nheard Ron say, \u201cHagrid! What are you doing in the\nlibrary?\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 257 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nHagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind\nhis back. He looked very out of place in his moleskin\novercoat.\n\n\u201cJus\u2019 lookin\u2019,\u201d he said, in a shifty voice that got their\ninterest at once. \u201cAn\u2019 what\u2019re you lot up ter?\u201d He\nlooked suddenly suspicious. \u201cYer not still lookin\u2019 fer\nNicolas Flamel, are yeh?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, we found out who he is ages ago,\u201d said Ron\nimpressively. \u201cAnd we know what that dog\u2019s guarding,\nit\u2019s a Sorcerer\u2019s St \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cShhhh\u201d Hagrid looked around quickly to see if\nanyone was listening. \u201cDon\u2019 go shoutin\u2019 about it,\nwhat\u2019s the matter with yeh?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a\nmatter of fact,\u201d said Harry, \u201cabout what\u2019s guarding\nthe Stone apart from Fluffy \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cSHHHH!\u201d said Hagrid again. \u201cListen \u2014 come an\u2019 see\nme later, I\u2019m not promisin\u2019 I\u2019ll tell yeh anythin\u2019, mind,\nbut don\u2019 go rabbitin\u2019 about it in here, students aren\u2019\ns\u2019pposed ter know. They\u2019ll think I\u2019ve told yeh \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cSee you later, then,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHagrid shuffled off.\n\n\u201cWhat was he hiding behind his back?\u201d said\nHermione thoughtfully.\n\n\u201cDo you think it had anything to do with the Stone?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to see what section he was in,\u201d said Ron,\nwho\u2019d had enough of working. He came back a\nminute later with a pile of books in his arms and\nslammed them down on the table.\n\nPage | 258 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDragons\'.\u201d he whispered. \u201cHagrid was looking up stuff\nabout dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great\nBritain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon\nKeeper\u2019s Guide.\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid \u2019s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the\nfirst time I ever met him,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s against our laws,\u201d said Ron. \u201cDragon\nbreeding was outlawed by the Warlocks\u2019 Convention\nof 1709, everyone knows that. It\u2019s hard to stop\nMuggles from noticing us if we\u2019re keeping dragons in\nthe back garden \u2014 anyway, you can\u2019t tame dragons,\nit\u2019s dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie\u2019s got\noff wild ones in Romania.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there aren\u2019t wild dragons in Britain?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cOf course there are,\u201d said Ron. \u201cCommon Welsh\nGreen and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic\nhas a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind\nhave to keep putting spells on Muggles who\u2019ve spotted\nthem, to make them forget.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what on earth\u2019s Hagrid up to?\u201d said Hermione.\n\nWhen they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper\u2019s\nhut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all\nthe curtains were closed. Hagrid called \u201cWho is it?\u201d\nbefore he let them in, and then shut the door quickly\nbehind them.\n\nIt was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a\nwarm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate.\n\nHagrid made them tea and offered them stoat\nsandwiches, which they refused.\n\n\u201cSo \u2014 yeh wanted to ask me somethin\u2019?\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 259 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. There was no point beating around\nthe bush. \u201cWe were wondering if you could tell us\nwhat\u2019s guarding the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone apart from\nFluffy.\u201d\n\nHagrid frowned at him.\n\n\u201cO\u2019 course I can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cNumber one, I don\u2019 know\nmeself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I\nwouldn\u2019 tell yeh if I could. That Stone\u2019s here fer a good\nreason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts \u2014 I\ns\u2019ppose yeh\u2019ve worked that out an\u2019 all? Beats me how\nyeh even know abou\u2019 Fluffy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us,\nbut you do know, you know everything that goes on\nround here,\u201d said Hermione in a warm, flattering\nvoice. Hagrid \u2019s beard twitched and they could tell he\nwas smiling. \u201cWe only wondered who had done the\nguarding, really.\u201d Hermione went on. \u201cWe wondered\nwho Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him,\napart from you.\u201d\n\nHagrid \u2019s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and\nRon beamed at Hermione.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019 s\u2019pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that ...\nlet\u2019s see ... he borrowed Fluffy from me ... then some\no\u2019 the teachers did enchantments ... Professor Sprout\n\u2014 Professor Flitwick \u2014 Professor McGonagall \u2014 \u201d he\nticked them off on his fingers, \u201cProfessor Quirrell \u2014\nan\u2019 Dumbledore himself did somethin\u2019, o\u2019 course.\n\nHang on, I\u2019ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor\nSnape.\u201d\n\n\u201cSnape?\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 260 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah \u2014 yer not still on abou\u2019 that, are yeh? Look,\nSnape helped protect the Stone, he\u2019s not about ter\nsteal it.\u201d\n\nHarry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the\nsame as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting\nthe Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the\nother teachers had guarded it. He probably knew\neverything \u2014 except, it seemed, Quirrell\u2019s spell and\nhow to get past Fluffy.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the only one who knows how to get past\nFluffy, aren\u2019t you, Hagrid?\u201d said Harry anxiously.\n\n\u201cAnd you wouldn\u2019t tell anyone, would you? Not even\none of the teachers?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a soul knows except me an\u2019 Dumbledore,\u201d said\nHagrid proudly.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s something,\u201d Harry muttered to the\nothers. \u201cHagrid, can we have a window open? I\u2019m\nboiling.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t, Harry, sorry,\u201d said Hagrid. Harry noticed him\nglance at the fire. Harry looked at it, too.\n\n\u201cHagrid \u2014 what\u2019s that?\u201d\n\nBut he already knew what it was. In the very heart of\nthe fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard,\n\u201cThat\u2019s \u2014 er ...\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did you get it, Hagrid?\u201d said Ron, crouching\nover the fire to get a closer look at the egg. \u201cIt must\u2019ve\ncost you a fortune.\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 261 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWon it,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cLas\u2019 night. I was down in the\nvillage havin\u2019 a few drinks an\u2019 got into a game o\u2019 cards\nwith a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of\nit, ter be honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what are you going to do with it when it\u2019s\nhatched?\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve bin doin\u2019 some readin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid, pulling\na large book from under his pillow. \u201cGot this outta the\nlibrary \u2014 Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit \u2014\nit\u2019s a bit outta date, o\u2019 course, but it\u2019s all in here. Keep\nthe egg in the fire, \u2019cause their mothers breathe on\n\u2019em, see, an\u2019 when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o\u2019\nbrandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An\u2019\nsee here \u2014 how ter recognize diff\u2019rent eggs \u2014 what I\ngot there\u2019s a Norwegian Ridge-back. They\u2019re rare,\nthem.\u201d\n\nHe looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione\ndidn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cHagrid, you live in a wooden house,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Hagrid wasn\u2019t listening. He was humming merrily\nas he stoked the fire.\n\nSo now they had something else to worry about: what\nmight happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was\nhiding an illegal dragon in his hut.\n\n\u201cWonder what it\u2019s like to have a peaceful life,\u201d Ron\nsighed, as evening after evening they struggled\nthrough all the extra homework they were getting.\nHermione had now started making study schedules\nfor Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.\n\n\n\nPage | 262 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nThen, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry\nanother note from Hagrid. He had written only two\nwords: It\u2019s hatching.\n\nRon wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to\nthe hut. Hermione wouldn\u2019t hear of it.\n\n\u201cHermione, how many times in our lives are we going\nto see a dragon hatching?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got lessons, we\u2019ll get into trouble, and that\u2019s\nnothing to what Hagrid \u2019s going to be in when someone\nfinds out what he\u2019s doing \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Harry whispered.\n\nMalfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped\ndead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn\u2019t\nlike the look on Malfoy\u2019s face at all.\n\nRon and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology\nand in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to\nHagrid\u2019s with the other two during morning break.\nWhen the bell sounded from the castle at the end of\ntheir lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels\nat once and hurried through the grounds to the edge\nof the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed\nand excited.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nearly out.\u201d He ushered them inside.\n\nThe egg was lying on the table. There were deep\ncracks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny\nclicking noise was coming from it.\n\nThey all drew their chairs up to the table and watched\nwith bated breath.\n\n\n\nPage | 263 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nAll at once there was a scraping noise and the egg\nsplit open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It\nwasn\u2019t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a\ncrumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge\ncompared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout\nwith wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging,\norange eyes.\n\nIt sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t he beautiful?\u201d Hagrid murmured. He reached\nout a hand to stroke the dragon\u2019s head. It snapped at\nhis fingers, showing pointed fangs.\n\n\u201cBless him, look, he knows his mommy!\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d said Hermione, \u201chow fast do Norwegian\nRidgebacks grow, exactly?\u201d\n\nHagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly\ndrained from his face \u2014 he leapt to his feet and ran to\nthe window.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone was lookin\u2019 through the gap in the curtains\n\u2014 it\u2019s a kid \u2014 he\u2019s runnin\u2019 back up ter the school.\u201d\n\nHarry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a\ndistance there was no mistaking him.\n\nMalfoy had seen the dragon.\n\nSomething about the smile lurking on Malfoy\u2019s face\nduring the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione\nvery nervous. They spent most of their free time in\nHagrid \u2019s darkened hut, trying to reason with him.\n\n\u201cJust let him go,\u201d Harry urged. \u201cSet him free.\u201d\n\nPage | 264 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cHe\u2019s too little. He\u2019d die.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey looked at the dragon. It had grown three times\nin length in just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its\nnostrils. Hagrid hadn\u2019t been doing his gamekeeping\nduties because the dragon was keeping him so busy.\nThere were empty brandy bottles and chicken\nfeathers all over the floor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve decided to call him Norbert,\u201d said Hagrid, looking\nat the dragon with misty eyes. \u201cHe really knows me\nnow, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where\u2019s Mommy?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s lost his marbles,\u201d Ron muttered in Harry\u2019s ear.\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d said Harry loudly, \u201cgive it two weeks and\nNorbert\u2019s going to be as long as your house. Malfoy\ncould go to Dumbledore at any moment.\u201d\n\nHagrid bit his lip.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 I know I can\u2019t keep him forever, but I can\u2019t jus\u2019\ndump him, can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHarry suddenly turned to Ron.\n\n\u201cCharlie,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re losing it, too,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI\u2019m Ron, remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 Charlie \u2014 your brother, Charlie. In Romania.\nStudying dragons. We could send Norbert to him.\nCharlie can take care of him and then put him back\nin the wild!\u201d\n\n\u201cBrilliant!\u201d said Ron. \u201cHow about it, Hagrid?\u201d\n\nAnd in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send\nan owl to Charlie to ask him.\n\nPage | 265 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nThe following week dragged by. Wednesday night\nfound Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the\ncommon room, long after everyone else had gone to\nbed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight\nwhen the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out\nof nowhere as he pulled off Harry\u2019s Invisibility Cloak.\nHe had been down at Hagrid\u2019s hut, helping him feed\nNorbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate.\n\n\u201cIt bit me!\u201d he said, showing them his hand, which\nwas wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. \u201cI\u2019m not going\nto be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that\ndragon\u2019s the most horrible animal I\u2019ve ever met, but\nthe way Hagrid goes on about it, you\u2019d think it was a\nfluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off\nfor frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a\nlullaby.\u201d\n\nThere was a tap on the dark window.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Hedwig!\u201d said Harry, hurrying to let her in. \u201cShe\u2019ll\nhave Charlie\u2019s answer!\u201d\n\nThe three of them put their heads together to read the\nnote.\n\nDear Ron,\n\nHow are you? Thanks for the letter \u2014 I\u2019d be glad to\ntake the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won\u2019t be easy\ngetting him here. I think the best thing will be to send\nhim over with some friends of mine who are coming to\nvisit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn\u2019t be seen\ncarrying an illegal dragon.\n\nCould you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at\nmidnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and\ntake him away while it\u2019s still dark.\n\n\n\nPage | 266 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nSend me an answer as soon as possible.\n\n\n\nLove,\n\nCharlie\n\nThey looked at one another.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the Invisibility Cloak,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt\nshouldn\u2019t be too difficult \u2014 I think the cloak\u2019s big\nenough to cover two of us and Norbert.\u201d\n\nIt was a mark of how bad the last week had been that\nthe other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of\nNorbert \u2014 and Malfoy.\n\nThere was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron\u2019s bitten\nhand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn\u2019t\nknow whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey \u2014\nwould she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon,\nthough, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty\nshade of green. It looked as if Norbert\u2019s fangs were\npoisonous.\n\nHarry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing\nat the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in\nbed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just my hand,\u201d he whispered, \u201calthough that\nfeels like it\u2019s about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam\nPomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he\ncould come and have a good laugh at me. He kept\nthreatening to tell her what really bit me \u2014 I\u2019ve told\nher it was a dog, but I don\u2019t think she believes me \u2014 I\nshouldn\u2019t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that\u2019s\nwhy he\u2019s doing this.\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.\n\nPage | 267 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,\u201d said\nHermione, but this didn\u2019t soothe Ron at all. On the\ncontrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat.\n\n\u201cMidnight on Saturday!\u201d he said in a hoarse voice.\n\n\u201cOh no \u2014 oh no \u2014 I\u2019ve just remembered \u2014 Charlie\u2019s\nletter was in that book Malfoy took, he\u2019s going to\nknow we\u2019re getting rid of Norbert.\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione didn\u2019t get a chance to answer.\nMadam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made\nthem leave, saying Ron needed sleep.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late to change the plan now,\u201d Harry told\nHermione. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got time to send Charlie\nanother owl, and this could be our only chance to get\nrid of Norbert. We\u2019ll have to risk it. And we have got\nthe Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn\u2019t know about\nthat.\u201d\n\nThey found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a\nbandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who\nopened a window to talk to them.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t let you in,\u201d he puffed. \u201cNorbert\u2019s at a tricky\nstage \u2014 nothin\u2019 I can\u2019t handle.\u201d\n\nWhen they told him about Charlie\u2019s letter, his eyes\nfilled with tears, although that might have been\nbecause Norbert had just bitten him on the leg.\n\n\u201cAargh! It\u2019s all right, he only got my boot \u2014 jus\u2019\nplayin\u2019 \u2014 he\u2019s only a baby, after all.\u201d\n\nThe baby banged its tail on the wall, making the\nwindows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to\nthe castle feeling Saturday couldn\u2019t come quickly\nenough.\n\n\n\nPage | 268 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nThey would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time\ncame for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn\u2019t\nbeen so worried about what they had to do. It was a\nvery dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late\narriving at Hagrid \u2019s hut because they\u2019d had to wait for\nPeeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall,\nwhere he\u2019d been playing tennis against the wall.\n\nHagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got lots o\u2019 rats an\u2019 some brandy fer the journey,\u201d\nsaid Hagrid in a muffled voice. \u201cAn\u2019 I\u2019ve packed his\nteddy bear in case he gets lonely.\u201d\n\nFrom inside the crate came ripping noises that\nsounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his\nhead torn off.\n\n\u201cBye-bye, Norbert!\u201d Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and\nHermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak\nand stepped underneath it themselves. \u201cMommy will\nnever forget you!\u201d\n\nHow they managed to get the crate back up to the\ncastle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as\nthey heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the\nentrance hall and along the dark corridors. Up\nanother staircase, then another \u2014 even one of Harry\u2019s\nshortcuts didn\u2019t make the work much easier.\n\n\u201cNearly there!\u201d Harry panted as they reached the\ncorridor beneath the tallest tower.\n\nThen a sudden movement ahead of them made them\nalmost drop the crate. Forgetting that they were\nalready invisible, they shrank into the shadows,\nstaring at the dark outlines of two people grappling\nwith each other ten feet away. A lamp flared.\n\n\n\nPage | 269 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nProfessor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair\nnet, had Malfoy by the ear.\n\n\n\n\u201cDetention!\u201d she shouted. \u201cAnd twenty points from\nSlytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the\nnight, how dare you \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Professor. Harry Potter\u2019s\ncoming \u2014 he\u2019s got a dragon!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies!\nCome on \u2014 I shall see Professor Snape about you,\nMalfoy!\u201d\n\nThe steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower\nseemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not\nuntil they\u2019d stepped out into the cold night air did\nthey throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe\nproperly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.\n\n\u201cMalfoy\u2019s got detention! I could sing!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Harry advised her.\n\nChuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert\nthrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later,\nfour broomsticks came swooping down out of the\ndarkness.\n\nCharlie\u2019s friends were a cheery lot. They showed\nHarry and Hermione the harness they\u2019d rigged up, so\nthey could suspend Norbert between them. They all\nhelped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry\nand Hermione shook hands with the others and\nthanked them very much.\n\nAt last, Norbert was going ... going ... gone.\n\n\n\nPage | 270 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nThey slipped back down the spiral staircase, their\nhearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was\noff them. No more dragon \u2014 Malfoy in detention \u2014\nwhat could spoil their happiness?\n\nThe answer to that was waiting at the foot of the\nstairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch\u2019s face\nloomed suddenly out of the darkness.\n\n\u201cWell, well, well,\u201d he whispered, \u201cwe are in trouble.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019d left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower.\n\n\n\nPage | 271 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE FORBIDDEN FOREST\n\nThings couldn\u2019t have been worse.\n\nFilch took them down to Professor McGonagall\u2019s\nstudy on the first floor, where they sat and waited\nwithout saying a word to each other. Hermione was\ntrembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories\nchased each other around Harry\u2019s brain, each more\nfeeble than the last. He couldn\u2019t see how they were\ngoing to get out of trouble this time. They were\ncornered. How could they have been so stupid as to\nforget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that\nProfessor McGonagall would accept for their being out\nof bed and creeping around the school in the dead of\nnight, let alone being up the tallest Astronomy Tower,\nwhich was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add\nNorbert and the Invisibility Cloak, and they might as\nwell be packing their bags already.\n\nHad Harry thought that things couldn\u2019t have been\nworse? He was wrong. When Professor McGonagall\nappeared, she was leading Neville.\n\n\n\nPage | 272 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d Neville burst out, the moment he saw the\nother two. \u201cI was trying to find you to warn you, I\nheard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he\nsaid you had a drag \u2014 \u201d\n\nHarry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but\nProfessor McGonagall had seen. She looked more\nlikely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over\nthe three of them.\n\n\u201cI would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch\nsays you were up in the Astronomy Tower. It\u2019s one\no\u2019clock in the morning. Explain yourselves.\u201d\n\nIt was the first time Hermione had ever failed to\nanswer a teacher\u2019s question. She was staring at her\nslippers, as still as a statue.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve got a good idea of what\u2019s been going on,\u201d\nsaid Professor McGonagall. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a genius\nto work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and-\nbull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed\nand into trouble. I\u2019ve already caught him. I suppose\nyou think it\u2019s funny that Longbottom here heard the\nstory and believed it, too?\u201d\n\nHarry caught Neville\u2019s eye and tried to tell him\nwithout words that this wasn\u2019t true, because Neville\nwas looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering\nNeville \u2014 Harry knew what it must have cost him to\ntry and find them in the dark, to warn them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disgusted,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cFour\nstudents out of bed in one night! I\u2019ve never heard of\nsuch a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you\nhad more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought\nGryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of\nyou will receive detentions \u2014 yes, you too, Mr.\nLongbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk\nPage | 273 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\naround school at night, especially these days, it\u2019s very\ndangerous \u2014 and fifty points will be taken from\nGryffindor.\u201d\n\n\u201cFifty?\u201d Harry gasped \u2014 they would lose the lead, the\nlead he\u2019d won in the last Quidditch match.\n\n\u201cFifty points each,\u201d said Professor McGonagall,\nbreathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.\n\n\u201cProfessor \u2014 please \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what I can and can\u2019t do, Potter. Now get\nback to bed, all of you. I\u2019ve never been more ashamed\nof Gryffindor students.\u201d\n\nA hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in\nlast place. In one night, they\u2019d ruined any chance\nGryffindor had had for the House Cup. Harry felt as\nthough the bottom had dropped out of his stomach.\nHow could they ever make up for this?\n\nHarry didn\u2019t sleep all night. He could hear Neville\nsobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours.\nHarry couldn\u2019t think of anything to say to comfort\nhim. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the\ndawn. What would happen when the rest of\nGryffindor found out what they\u2019d done?\n\nAt first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses\nthat recorded the House points the next day thought\nthere \u2019d been a mistake. How could they suddenly\nhave a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday?\nAnd then the story started to spread: Harry Potter,\nthe famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch\nmatches, had lost them all those points, him and a\ncouple of other stupid first years.\n\nPage | 274 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nFrom being one of the most popular and admired\npeople at the school, Harry was suddenly the most\nhated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on\nhim, because everyone had been longing to see\nSlytherin lose the House Cup. Everywhere Harry\nwent, people pointed and didn\u2019t trouble to lower their\nvoices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other\nhand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and\ncheering, \u201cThanks Potter, we owe you one!\u201d\n\nOnly Ron stood by him.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George\nhave lost loads of points in all the time they\u2019ve been\nhere, and people still like them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one\ngo, though, have they?\u201d said Harry miserably.\n\n\u201cWell \u2014 no,\u201d Ron admitted.\n\nIt was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry\nswore to himself not to meddle in things that weren\u2019t\nhis business from now on. He\u2019d had it with sneaking\naround and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that\nhe went to Wood and offered to resign from the\nQuidditch team.\n\n\u201cResign?\u201d Wood thundered. \u201cWhat good\u2019ll that do?\n\nHow are we going to get any points back if we can\u2019t\nwin at Quidditch?\u201d\n\nBut even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the\nteam wouldn\u2019t speak to Harry during practice, and if\nthey had to speak about him, they called him \u201cthe\nSeeker.\u201d\n\nHermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn\u2019t\nhave as bad a time as Harry, because they weren\u2019t as\n\nPage | 275 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nwell-known, but nobody would speak to them, either.\nHermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in\nclass, keeping her head down and working in silence.\n\nHarry was almost glad that the exams weren\u2019t far\naway. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off\nhis misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to\nthemselves, working late into the night, trying to\nremember the ingredients in complicated potions,\nlearn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates\nof magical discoveries and goblin rebellions. ...\n\nThen, about a week before the exams were due to\nstart, Harry\u2019s new resolution not to interfere in\nanything that didn\u2019t concern him was put to an\nunexpected test. Walking back from the library on his\nown one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering\nfrom a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he\nheard Quirrell\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 no \u2014 not again, please \u2014 \u201d\n\nIt sounded as though someone was threatening him.\nHarry moved closer.\n\n\u201cAll right \u2014 all right \u2014 \u201d he heard Quirrell sob.\n\nNext second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the\nclassroom straightening his turban. He was pale and\nlooked as though he was about to cry. He strode out\nof sight; Harry didn\u2019t think Quirrell had even noticed\nhim. He waited until Quirrell\u2019s footsteps had\ndisappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was\nempty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry\nwas halfway toward it before he remembered what\nhe\u2019d promised himself about not meddling.\n\nAll the same, he\u2019d have gambled twelve Sorcerer\u2019s\nStones that Snape had just left the room, and from\n\nPage | 276 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nwhat Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking\nwith a new spring in his step \u2014 Quirrell seemed to\nhave given in at last.\n\nHarry went back to the library, where Hermione was\ntesting Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he\u2019d\nheard.\n\n\u201cSnape\u2019s done it, then!\u201d said Ron. \u201cIf Quirrell\u2019s told\nhim how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still Fluffy, though,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cMaybe Snape\u2019s found out how to get past him\nwithout asking Hagrid,\u201d said Ron, looking up at the\nthousands of books surrounding them. \u201cI bet there\u2019s a\nbook somewhere in here telling you how to get past a\ngiant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?\u201d\n\nThe light of adventure was kindling again in Ron\u2019s\neyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.\n\n\u201cGo to Dumbledore. That\u2019s what we should have done\nages ago. If we try anything ourselves we\u2019ll be thrown\nout for sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019ve got no proof.\u201d said Harry. \u201cQuirrell\u2019s too\nscared to back us up. Snape\u2019s only got to say he\ndoesn\u2019t know how the troll got in at Halloween and\nthat he was nowhere near the third floor \u2014 who do\nyou think they\u2019ll believe, him or us? It\u2019s not exactly a\nsecret we hate him, Dumbledore \u2019ll think we made it\nup to get him sacked. Filch wouldn\u2019t help us if his life\ndepended on it, he\u2019s too friendly with Snape, and the\nmore students get thrown out, the better, he\u2019ll think.\nAnd don\u2019t forget, we\u2019re not supposed to know about\nthe Stone or Fluffy. That\u2019ll take a lot of explaining.\u201d\n\nHermione looked convinced, but Ron didn\u2019t.\n\nPage | 277 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf we just do a bit of poking around \u2014 \u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry flatly, \u201cwe\u2019ve done enough poking\naround.\u201d\n\nHe pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to\nlearn the names of its moons.\n\nThe following morning, notes were delivered to Harry,\nHermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They\nwere all the same:\n\nYour detention will take place at eleven o\u2019clock\ntonight.\n\nMeet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall.\n\nProfessor M. McGonagall\n\nHarry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in\nthe furor over the points they\u2019d lost. He half expected\nHermione to complain that this was a whole night of\nstudying lost, but she didn\u2019t say a word. Like Harry,\nshe felt they deserved what they\u2019d got.\n\nAt eleven o\u2019clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron\nin the common room and went down to the entrance\nhall with Neville. Filch was already there \u2014 and so\nwas Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had\ngotten a detention, too.\n\n\u201cFollow me,\u201d said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading\nthem outside.\n\n\u201cI bet you\u2019ll think twice about breaking a school rule\nagain, won\u2019t you, eh?\u201d he said, leering at them. \u201cOh\nyes . . . hard work and pain are the best teachers if you\nask me. ... It\u2019s just a pity they let the old\npunishments die out . . . hang you by your wrists from\nPage | 278 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nthe ceiling for a few days, I\u2019ve got the chains still in\nmy office, keep \u2019em well oiled in case they\u2019re ever\nneeded. ... Right, off we go, and don\u2019t think of running\noff, now, it\u2019ll be worse for you if you do.\u201d\n\nThey marched off across the dark grounds. Neville\nkept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment\nwas going to be. It must be something really horrible,\nor Filch wouldn\u2019t be sounding so delighted.\n\nThe moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it\nkept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry\ncould see the lighted windows of Hagrid\u2019s hut. Then\nthey heard a distant shout.\n\n\u201cIs that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart rose; if they were going to be working\nwith Hagrid it wouldn\u2019t be so bad. His relief must\nhave showed in his face, because Filch said, \u201cI\nsuppose you think you\u2019ll be enjoying yourself with\nthat oaf? Well, think again, boy \u2014 it\u2019s into the forest\nyou\u2019re going and I\u2019m much mistaken if you\u2019ll all come\nout in one piece.\u201d\n\nAt this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy\nstopped dead in his tracks.\n\n\u201cThe forest?\u201d he repeated, and he didn\u2019t sound quite\nas cool as usual. \u201cWe can\u2019t go in there at night \u2014\nthere\u2019s all sorts of things in there \u2014 werewolves, I\nheard.\u201d\n\nNeville clutched the sleeve of Harry\u2019s robe and made a\nchoking noise.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s your problem, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Filch, his voice\ncracking with glee. \u201cShould\u2019ve thought of them\nwerewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nPage | 279 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nHagrid came striding toward them out of the dark,\nFang at his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow,\nand a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder.\n\n\u201cAbou\u2019 time,\u201d he said. \u201cI bin waitin\u2019 fer half an hour\nalready. All right, Harry, Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,\u201d said\nFilch coldly, \u201cthey\u2019re here to be punished, after all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why yer late, is it?\u201d said Hagrid, frowning at\nFilch. \u201cBin lecturin\u2019 them, eh? \u2019Snot your place ter do\nthat. Yeh\u2019ve done yer bit, I\u2019ll take over from here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back at dawn,\u201d said Filch, \u201cfor what\u2019s left of\nthem,\u201d he added nastily, and he turned and started\nback toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the\ndarkness.\n\nMalfoy now turned to Hagrid.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going in that forest,\u201d he said, and Harry was\npleased to hear the note of panic in his voice.\n\n\u201cYeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,\u201d said\nHagrid fiercely. \u201cYeh\u2019ve done wrong an\u2019 now yeh\u2019ve got\nter pay fer it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is servant stuff, it\u2019s not for students to do. I\nthought we\u2019d be copying lines or something, if my\nfather knew I was doing this, he\u2019d \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201c \u2014 tell yer that\u2019s how it is at Hogwarts,\u201d Hagrid\ngrowled. \u201cCopyin\u2019 lines! What good\u2019s that ter anyone?\nYeh\u2019ll do summat useful or yeh\u2019ll get out. If yeh think\nyer father\u2019d rather you were expelled, then get back\noff ter the castle an\u2019 pack. Go on!\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 280 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nMalfoy didn\u2019t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but\nthen dropped his gaze.\n\n\u201cRight then,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cnow, listen carefully,\n\n\u2019cause it\u2019s dangerous what we\u2019re gonna do tonight, an\u2019\nI don\u2019 want no one takin\u2019 risks. Follow me over here a\nmoment.\u201d\n\nHe led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his\nlamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding\nearth track that disappeared into the thick black\ntrees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked\ninto the forest.\n\n\u201cLook there,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201csee that stuff shinin\u2019 on\nthe ground? Silvery stuff? That\u2019s unicorn blood.\nThere\u2019s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat.\nThis is the second time in a week. I found one dead\nlast Wednesday. We\u2019re gonna try an\u2019 find the poor\nthing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us\nfirst?\u201d said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his\nvoice.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothin\u2019 that lives in the forest that\u2019ll hurt yeh\nif yer with me or Fang,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAn\u2019 keep ter the\npath. Right, now, we\u2019re gonna split inter two parties\nan\u2019 follow the trail in diff\u2019rent directions. There\u2019s blood\nall over the place, it must\u2019ve bin staggerin\u2019 around\nsince last night at least.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want Fang,\u201d said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang\u2019s\nlong teeth.\n\n\u201cAll right, but I warn yeh, he\u2019s a coward,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\u201cSo me, Harry, an\u2019 Hermione\u2019ll go one way an\u2019 Draco,\nNeville, an\u2019 Fang\u2019ll go the other. Now, if any of us\nfinds the unicorn, we\u2019ll send up green sparks, right?\n\nPage | 281 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nGet yer wands out an\u2019 practice now \u2014 that\u2019s it \u2014 an\u2019\nif anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an\u2019 we\u2019ll\nall come an\u2019 find yeh \u2014 so, be careful \u2014 let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nThe forest was black and silent. A little way into it\nthey reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry,\nHermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy,\nNeville, and Fang took the right.\n\nThey walked in silence, their eyes on the ground.\nEvery now and then a ray of moonlight through the\nbranches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the\nfallen leaves.\n\nHarry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.\n\n\u201c Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?\u201d Harry\nasked.\n\n\u201cNot fast enough,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy ter catch\na unicorn, they\u2019re powerful magic creatures. I never\nknew one ter be hurt before.\u201d\n\nThey walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could\nhear running water; there must be a stream\nsomewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn\nblood here and there along the winding path.\n\n\u201cYou all right, Hermione?\u201d Hagrid whispered. \u201cDon\u2019\nworry, it can\u2019t\u2019ve gone far if it\u2019s this badly hurt, an\u2019\nthen well be able ter \u2014 GET BEHIND THAT TREE!\u201d\n\nHagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them\noff the path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an\narrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready\nto fire. The three of them listened. Something was\nslithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a\ncloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting\n\n\n\nPage | 282 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nup the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound\nfaded away.\n\n\u201cI knew it,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThere\u2019s summat in here\nthat shouldn\u2019 be.\u201d\n\n\u201cA werewolf?\u201d Harry suggested.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019 no werewolf an\u2019 it wasn\u2019 no unicorn,\nneither,\u201d said Hagrid grimly. \u201cRight, follow me, but\ncareful, now.\u201d\n\nThey walked more slowly, ears straining for the\nfaintest sound. Suddenly, in a clearing ahead,\nsomething definitely moved.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Hagrid called. \u201cShow yerself \u2014 I\u2019m\narmed!\u201d\n\nAnd into the clearing came \u2014 was it a man, or a\nhorse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard,\nbut below that was a horse\u2019s gleaming chestnut body\nwith a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione\u2019s jaws\ndropped.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s you, Ronan,\u201d said Hagrid in relief. \u201cHow are\nyeh?\u201d\n\nHe walked forward and shook the centaur\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cGood evening to you, Hagrid,\u201d said Ronan. He had a\ndeep, sorrowful voice. \u201cWere you going to shoot me?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t be too careful, Ronan,\u201d said Hagrid, patting his\ncrossbow. \u201cThere\u2019s summat bad loose in this forest.\nThis is Harry Potter an\u2019 Hermione Granger, by the\nway. Students up at the school. An\u2019 this is Ronan,\nyou two. He\u2019s a centaur.\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 283 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d noticed,\u201d said Hermione faintly.\n\n\n\n\u201cGood evening,\u201d said Ronan. \u201cStudents, are you? And\ndo you learn much, up at the school?\u201d\n\n\u201cErm \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cA bit,\u201d said Hermione timidly.\n\n\u201cA bit. Well, that\u2019s something.\u201d Ronan sighed. He\nflung back his head and stared at the sky. \u201cMars is\nbright tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Hagrid, glancing up, too. \u201cListen, I\u2019m glad\nwe\u2019ve run inter yeh, Ronan, \u2019cause there\u2019s a unicorn\nbin hurt \u2014 you seen anythin\u2019?\u201d\n\nRonan didn\u2019t answer immediately. He stared\nunblinkingly upward, then sighed again.\n\n\u201cAlways the innocent are the first victims,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo it has been for ages past, so it is now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cbut have yeh seen anythin\u2019,\nRonan? Anythin\u2019 unusual?\u201d\n\n\u201cMars is bright tonight,\u201d Ronan repeated, while\nHagrid watched him impatiently. \u201cUnusually bright.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but I was meanin\u2019 anythin\u2019 unusual a bit\nnearer home,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cSo yeh haven\u2019t noticed\nanythin\u2019 strange?\u201d\n\nYet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he\nsaid, \u201cThe forest hides many secrets.\u201d\n\nA movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid\nraise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur,\n\nPage | 284 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nblack-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than\nRonan.\n\n\n\n\u201cHullo, Bane,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAll right?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell enough. Look, I\u2019ve jus\u2019 bin askin\u2019 Ronan, you\nseen anythin\u2019 odd in here lately? There\u2019s a unicorn\nbin injured \u2014 would yeh know anythin\u2019 about it?\u201d\n\nBane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked\nskyward.\n\n\u201cMars is bright tonight,\u201d he said simply.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard,\u201d said Hagrid grumpily. \u201cWell, if either of\nyou do see anythin\u2019, let me know, won\u2019t yeh? We\u2019ll be\noff, then.\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing,\nstaring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until\nthe trees blocked their view.\n\n\u201cNever,\u201d said Hagrid irritably, \u201ctry an\u2019 get a straight\nanswer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not\ninterested in anythin\u2019 closer\u2019n the moon.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre there many of them in here?\u201d asked Hermione.\n\n\u201cOh, a fair few. . . . Keep themselves to themselves\nmostly, but they\u2019re good enough about turnin\u2019 up if\never I want a word. They\u2019re deep, mind, centaurs ...\nthey know things ... jus\u2019 don\u2019 let on much.\u201d\n\n\u201cD\u2019you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?\u201d\nsaid Harry.\n\n\n\nPage | 285 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDid that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask\nme, that was what\u2019s bin killin\u2019 the unicorns \u2014 never\nheard anythin\u2019 like it before.\u201d\n\nThey walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry\nkept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had the\nnasty feeling they were being watched. He was very\nglad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them.\nThey had just passed a bend in the path when\nHermione grabbed Hagrid \u2019s arm.\n\n\u201cHagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou two wait here!\u201d Hagrid shouted. \u201cStay on the\npath, I\u2019ll come back for yeh!\u201d\n\nThey heard him crashing away through the\nundergrowth and stood looking at each other, very\nscared, until they couldn\u2019t hear anything but the\nrustling of leaves around them.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think they\u2019ve been hurt, do you?\u201d\nwhispered Hermione.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if Malfoy has, but if something\u2019s got\nNeville ... it\u2019s our fault he\u2019s here in the first place.\u201d\n\nThe minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper\nthan usual. Harry\u2019s seemed to be picking up every\nsigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was going\non? Where were the others?\n\nAt last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid\u2019s\nreturn. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him.\nHagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked\nup behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville\nhad panicked and sent up the sparks.\n\n\n\nPage | 286 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWell be lucky ter catch anythin\u2019 now, with the racket\nyou two were makin\u2019. Right, we\u2019re changin\u2019 groups \u2014\nNeville, you stay with me an\u2019 Hermione, Harry, you go\nwith Fang an\u2019 this idiot. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Hagrid added in a\nwhisper to Harry, \u201cbut he\u2019ll have a harder time\nfrightenin\u2019 you, an\u2019 we\u2019ve gotta get this done.\u201d\n\nSo Harry set off into the heart of the forest with\nMalfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an\nhour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path\nbecame almost impossible to follow because the trees\nwere so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be\ngetting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a\ntree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing\naround in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing\nahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient\noak.\n\n\u201cLook \u2014 \u201d he murmured, holding out his arm to stop\nMalfoy.\n\nSomething bright white was gleaming on the ground.\nThey inched closer.\n\nIt was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry\nhad never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its\nlong, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where\nit had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on\nthe dark leaves.\n\nHarry had taken one step toward it when a slithering\nsound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on\nthe edge of the clearing quivered. ... Then, out of the\nshadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the\nground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and\nFang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the\nunicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the\nanimals side, and began to drink its blood.\n\n\n\nPage | 287 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAAAAAAAAAAARGH ! \u201d\n\n\n\nMalfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted \u2014 so did\nFang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked\nright at Harry \u2014 unicorn blood was dribbling down its\nfront. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry\n\u2014 he couldn\u2019t move for fear.\n\nThen a pain like he\u2019d never felt before pierced his\nhead; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half\nblinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves\nbehind him, galloping, and something jumped clean\nover Harry, charging at the figure.\n\nThe pain in Harry\u2019s head was so bad he fell to his\nknees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he\nlooked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was\nstanding over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one\nlooked younger; he had white-blond hair and a\npalomino body.\n\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d said the centaur, pulling Harry to\nhis feet.\n\n\u201cYes \u2014 thank you \u2014 what was that?\u201d\n\nThe centaur didn\u2019t answer. He had astonishingly blue\neyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at\nHarry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out,\nlivid, on Harry\u2019s forehead.\n\n\u201cYou are the Potter boy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou had better get\nback to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time \u2014\nespecially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker\nthis way.\n\n\u201cMy name is Firenze,\u201d he added, as he lowered\nhimself on to his front legs so that Harry could\nclamber onto his back.\n\nPage | 288 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nThere was suddenly a sound of more galloping from\nthe other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came\nbursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and\nsweaty.\n\n\u201cFirenze!\u201d Bane thundered. \u201cWhat are you doing? You\nhave a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are\nyou a common mule?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you realize who this is?\u201d said Firenze. \u201cThis is the\nPotter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the\nbetter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat have you been telling him?\u201d growled Bane.\n\u201cRemember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set\nourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what\nis to come in the movements of the planets?\u201d\n\nRonan pawed the ground nervously. \u201cI\u2019m sure Firenze\nthought he was acting for the best,\u201d he said in his\ngloomy voice.\n\nBane kicked his back legs in anger.\n\n\u201cFor the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs\nare concerned with what has been foretold! It is not\nour business to run around like donkeys after stray\nhumans in our forest!\u201d\n\nFirenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger,\nso that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.\n\n\u201cDo you not see that unicorn?\u201d Firenze bellowed at\nBane. \u201cDo you not understand why it was killed? Or\nhave the planets not let you in on that secret? I set\nmyself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane,\nyes, with humans alongside me if I must.\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 289 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nAnd Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on\nas best he could, they plunged off into the trees,\nleaving Ronan and Bane behind them.\n\nHarry didn\u2019t have a clue what was going on.\n\n\u201cWhy\u2019s Bane so angry?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat was that\nthing you saved me from, anyway?\u201d\n\nFirenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his\nhead bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did\nnot answer Harry\u2019s question. They made their way\nthrough the trees in silence for so long that Harry\nthought Firenze didn\u2019t want to talk to him anymore.\nThey were passing through a particularly dense patch\nof trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is\nused for?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, startled by the odd question. \u201cWe\u2019ve\nonly used the horn and tail hair in Potions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a\nunicorn,\u201d said Firenze. \u201cOnly one who has nothing to\nlose, and everything to gain, would commit such a\ncrime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even\nif you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price.\nYou have slain something pure and defenseless to\nsave yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a\ncursed life, from the moment the blood touches your\nlips.\u201d\n\nHarry stared at the back of Firenze\u2019s head, which was\ndappled silver in the moonlight.\n\n\u201cBut who\u2019d be that desperate?\u201d he wondered aloud. \u201cIf\nyou\u2019re going to be cursed forever, death\u2019s better, isn\u2019t\nit?\u201d\n\nPage | 290 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Firenze agreed, \u201cunless all you need is to stay\nalive long enough to drink something else \u2014\nsomething that will bring you back to full strength\nand power \u2014 something that will mean you can never\ndie. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the\nschool at this very moment?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Sorcerer\u2019s Stone! Of course \u2014 the Elixir of Life!\nBut I don\u2019t understand who \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cCan you think of nobody who has waited many years\nto return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting\ntheir chance?\u201d\n\nIt was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly\naround Harry\u2019s heart. Over the rustling of the trees,\nhe seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told\nhim on the night they had met: \u201cSome say he died.\nCodswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough\nhuman left in him to die.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean,\u201d Harry croaked, \u201cthat was VoZ \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cHarry! Harry, are you all right?\u201d\n\nHermione was running toward them down the path,\nHagrid puffing along behind her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d said Harry, hardly knowing what he was\nsaying. \u201cThe unicorn\u2019s dead, Hagrid, it\u2019s in that\nclearing back there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is where I leave you,\u201d Firenze murmured as\nHagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. \u201cYou are\nsafe now.\u201d\n\nHarry slid off his back.\n\n\n\nPage | 291 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGood luck, Harry Potter,\u201d said Firenze. \u201cThe planets\nhave been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs.\nI hope this is one of those times.\u201d\n\nHe turned and cantered back into the depths of the\nforest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.\n\nRon had fallen asleep in the dark common room,\nwaiting for them to return. He shouted something\nabout Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him\nawake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-\neyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what\nhad happened in the forest.\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t sit down. He paced up and down in\nfront of the fire. He was still shaking.\n\n\u201cSnape wants the Stone for Voldemort ... and\nVoldemort\u2019s waiting in the forest ... and all this time\nwe thought Snape just wanted to get rich. ...\u201d\n\n\u201cStop saying the name!\u201d said Ron in a terrified\nwhisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them.\n\nHarry wasn\u2019t listening.\n\n\u201cFirenze saved me, but he shouldn\u2019t have done so. ...\nBane was furious ... he was talking about interfering\nwith what the planets say is going to happen. ... They\nmust show that Voldemort\u2019s coming back. ... Bane\nthinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me. ... I\nsuppose that\u2019s written in the stars as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you stop saying the name\u201d Ron hissed.\n\n\u201cSo all I\u2019ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the\nStone,\u201d Harry went on feverishly, \u201cthen Voldemort will\nbe able to come and finish me off. ... Well, I suppose\nBane 11 be happy.\u201d\n\nPage | 292 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nHermione looked very frightened, but she had a word\nof comfort.\n\n\u201cHarry, everyone says Dumbledore\u2019s the only one\nYou-Know-Who was ever afraid of. With Dumbledore\naround, You-Know-Who won\u2019t touch you. Anyway,\nwho says the centaurs are right? It sounds like\nfortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says\nthat\u2019s a very imprecise branch of magic.\u201d\n\nThe sky had turned light before they stopped talking.\nThey went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But\nthe night\u2019s surprises weren\u2019t over.\n\nWhen Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his\nInvisibility Cloak folded neatly underneath them.\nThere was a note pinned to it:\n\nJust in case.\n\n\n\nPage | 293 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHROUGH THE TRAPDOOR\n\nIn years to come, Harry would never quite remember\nhow he had managed to get through his exams when\nhe half expected Voldemort to come bursting through\nthe door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and\nthere could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and\nwell behind the locked door.\n\nIt was sweltering hot, especially in the large\nclassroom where they did their written papers. They\nhad been given special, new quills for the exams,\nwhich had been bewitched with an Anti-Cheating\nspell.\n\nThey had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick\ncalled them one by one into his class to see if they\ncould make a pineapple tap-dance across a desk.\nProfessor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse\ninto a snuffbox \u2014 points were given for how pretty the\nsnuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers.\nSnape made them all nervous, breathing down their\nnecks while they tried to remember how to make a\nForgetfulness potion.\n\nPage | 294 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\nHarry did the best he could, trying to ignore the\nstabbing pains in his forehead, which had been\nbothering him ever since his trip into the forest.\nNeville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves\nbecause Harry couldn\u2019t sleep, but the truth was that\nHarry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except\nthat it was now worse than ever because there was a\nhooded figure dripping blood in it.\n\nMaybe it was because they hadn\u2019t seen what Harry\nhad seen in the forest, or because they didn\u2019t have\nscars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and\nHermione didn\u2019t seem as worried about the Stone as\nHarry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them,\nbut he didn\u2019t keep visiting them in dreams, and they\nwere so busy with their studying they didn\u2019t have\nmuch time to fret about what Snape or anyone else\nmight be up to.\n\nTheir very last exam was History of Magic. One hour\nof answering questions about batty old wizards who\u2019d\ninvented self-stirring cauldrons and they\u2019d be free,\nfree for a whole wonderful week until their exam\nresults came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns\ntold them to put down their quills and roll up their\nparchment, Harry couldn\u2019t help cheering with the\nrest.\n\n\u201cThat was far easier than I thought it would be,\u201d said\nHermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto\nthe sunny grounds. \u201cI needn\u2019t have learned about the\n1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of\nElfric the Eager.\u201d\n\nHermione always liked to go through their exam\npapers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill,\nso they wandered down to the lake and flopped under\na tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were\n\n\n\nPage | 295 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\ntickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was\nbasking in the warm shallows.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo more studying,\u201d Ron sighed happily, stretching\nout on the grass. \u201cYou could look more cheerful,\n\nHarry, we\u2019ve got a week before we find out how badly\nwe\u2019ve done, there\u2019s no need to worry yet.\u201d\n\nHarry was rubbing his forehead.\n\n\u201cI wish I knew what this means\u201d he burst out angrily.\n\u201cMy scar keeps hurting \u2014 it\u2019s happened before, but\nnever as often as this.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo to Madam Pomfrey,\u201d Hermione suggested.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not ill,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI think it\u2019s a warning ... it\nmeans danger\u2019s coming. ...\u201d\n\nRon couldn\u2019t get worked up, it was too hot.\n\n\u201cHarry, relax, Hermione \u2019s right, the Stone\u2019s safe as\nlong as Dumbledore\u2019s around. Anyway, we\u2019ve never\nhad any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy.\nHe nearly had his leg ripped off once, he\u2019s not going to\ntry it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch\nfor England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.\u201d\n\nHarry nodded, but he couldn\u2019t shake off a lurking\nfeeling that there was something he\u2019d forgotten to do,\nsomething important. When he tried to explain this,\nHermione said, \u201cThat\u2019s just the exams. I woke up last\nnight and was halfway through my Transfiguration\nnotes before I remembered we\u2019d done that one.\u201d\n\nHarry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn\u2019t have\nanything to do with work, though. He watched an owl\nflutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a\nnote clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one\n\nPage | 296 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nwho ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray\nDumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to\nget past Fluffy . . . never . . . but \u2014\n\nHarry suddenly jumped to his feet.\n\n\u201cWhere \u2019re you going?\u201d said Ron sleepily.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just thought of something,\u201d said Harry. He had\nturned white. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s a bit odd,\u201d said Harry,\nscrambling up the grassy slope, \u201cthat what Hagrid\nwants more than anything else is a dragon, and a\nstranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in\nhis pocket? How many people wander around with\ndragon eggs if it\u2019s against wizard law? Lucky they\nfound Hagrid, don\u2019t you think? Why didn\u2019t I see it\nbefore?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d said Ron, but Harry,\nsprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn\u2019t\nanswer.\n\nHagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house;\nhis trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was\nshelling peas into a large bowl.\n\n\u201cHullo,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cFinished yer exams? Got\ntime fer a drink?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, please,\u201d said Ron, but Harry cut him off.\n\n\u201cNo, we\u2019re in a hurry. Hagrid, I\u2019ve got to ask you\nsomething. You know that night you won Norbert?\nWhat did the stranger you were playing cards with\nlook like?\u201d\n\nPage | 297 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDunno said Hagrid casually, \u201che wouldn\u2019 take his\ncloak off.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe saw the three of them look stunned and raised his\neyebrows.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o\u2019 funny folk in\nthe Hog\u2019s Head \u2014 that\u2019s one o\u2019 the pubs down in the\nvillage. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn\u2019 he? I\nnever saw his face, he kept his hood up.\u201d\n\nHarry sank down next to the bowl of peas.\n\n\u201cWhat did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you\nmention Hogwarts at all?\u201d\n\n\u201cMighta come up,\u201d said Hagrid, frowning as he tried\nto remember. \u201cYeah ... he asked what I did, an\u2019 I told\nhim I was gamekeeper here. ... He asked a bit about\nthe sorta creatures I look after ... so I told him ... an\u2019 I\nsaid what I\u2019d always really wanted was a dragon ...\nan\u2019 then ... I can\u2019 remember too well, \u2019cause he kept\nbuyin\u2019 me drinks. ... Let\u2019s see ... yeah, then he said he\nhad the dragon egg an\u2019 we could play cards fer it if I\nwanted . . . but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he\ndidn\u2019 want it ter go ter any old home. ... So I told him,\nafter Fluffy, a dragon would be easy. ...\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd did he \u2014 did he seem interested in Fluffy?\u201d\n\nHarry asked, trying to keep his voice calm.\n\n\u201cWell \u2014 yeah \u2014 how many three-headed dogs d\u2019yeh\nmeet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy\u2019s a\npiece o\u2019 cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus\u2019\nplay him a bit o\u2019 music an\u2019 he\u2019ll go straight off ter\nsleep \u2014 \u201d\n\nHagrid suddenly looked horrified.\n\nPage | 298 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019ta told yeh that!\u201d he blurted out. \u201cForget I\nsaid it! Hey \u2014 where\u2019re yeh goin\u2019?\u201d\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione didn\u2019t speak to each other\nat all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall,\nwhich seemed very cold and gloomy after the\ngrounds.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go to Dumbledore,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHagrid\ntold that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was\neither Snape or Voldemort under that cloak \u2014 it\nmust\u2019ve been easy, once he\u2019d got Hagrid drunk. I just\nhope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us\nup if Bane doesn\u2019t stop him. Where\u2019s Dumbledore\u2019s\noffice?\u201d\n\nThey looked around, as if hoping to see a sign\npointing them in the right direction. They had never\nbeen told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know\nanyone who had been sent to see him.\n\n\u201cWell just have to \u2014 \u201d Harry began, but a voice\nsuddenly rang across the hall.\n\n\u201cWhat are you three doing inside?\u201d\n\nIt was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of\nbooks.\n\n\u201cWe want to see Professor Dumbledore,\u201d said\nHermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.\n\n\u201cSee Professor Dumbledore?\u201d Professor McGonagall\nrepeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to\nwant to do. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nHarry swallowed \u2014 now what?\n\n\n\nPage | 299 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of secret,\u201d he said, but he wished at once he\nhadn\u2019t, because Professor McGonagall\u2019s nostrils\nflared.\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,\u201d she said\ncoldly. \u201cHe received an urgent owl from the Ministry\nof Magic and flew off for London at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone?\u201d said Harry frantically. \u201cNow?\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter,\nhe has many demands on his time \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is important.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething you have to say is more important than\nthe Ministry of Magic, Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d said Harry, throwing caution to the winds,\n\u201cProfessor \u2014 it\u2019s about the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone \u2014 \u201d\n\nWhatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it\nwasn\u2019t that. The books she was carrying tumbled out\nof her arms, but she didn\u2019t pick them up.\n\n\u201cHow do you know \u2014 ?\u201d she spluttered.\n\n\u201cProfessor, I think \u2014 I know \u2014 that Sn \u2014 that\nsomeone\u2019s going to try and steal the Stone. I\u2019ve got to\ntalk to Professor Dumbledore.\u201d\n\nShe eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,\u201d she\nsaid finally. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you found out about\nthe Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal\nit, it\u2019s too well protected.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Professor \u2014 \u201d\n\nPage | 300 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPotter, I know what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d she said\nshortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen\nbooks. \u201cI suggest you all go back outside and enjoy\nthe sunshine.\u201d\n\nBut they didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tonight,\u201d said Harry, once he was sure Professor\nMcGonagall was out of earshot. \u201cSnape\u2019s going\nthrough the trapdoor tonight. He\u2019s found out\neverything he needs, and now he\u2019s got Dumbledore\nout of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of\nMagic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns\nup.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what can we \u2014 \u201d\n\nHermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.\nSnape was standing there.\n\n\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d he said smoothly.\n\nThey stared at him.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be inside on a day like this,\u201d he said,\nwith an odd, twisted smile.\n\n\u201cWe were \u2014 \u201d Harry began, without any idea what he\nwas going to say.\n\n\u201cYou want to be more careful,\u201d said Snape. \u201cHanging\naround like this, people will think you\u2019re up to\nsomething. And Gryffindor really can\u2019t afford to lose\nany more points, can it?\u201d\n\nHarry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape\ncalled them back.\n\n\n\nPage | 301 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBe warned, Potter \u2014 any more nighttime wanderings\nand I will personally make sure you are expelled.\n\nGood day to you.\u201d\n\nHe strode off in the direction of the staffroom.\n\nOut on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.\n\n\u201cRight, here\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to do,\u201d he whispered\nurgently. \u201cOne of us has got to keep an eye on Snape\n\u2014 wait outside the staffroom and follow him if he\nleaves it. Hermione, you\u2019d better do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy me?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious,\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou can pretend to be\nwaiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.\u201d He put on a\nhigh voice, \u201c \u2018Oh Professor Flitwick, I\u2019m so worried, I\nthink I got question fourteen b wrong. . . . \u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d said Hermione, but she agreed to go\nand watch out for Snape.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,\u201d\nHarry told Ron. \u201cCome on.\u201d\n\nBut that part of the plan didn\u2019t work. No sooner had\nthey reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest\nof the school than Professor McGonagall turned up\nagain and this time, she lost her temper.\n\n\u201cI suppose you think you\u2019re harder to get past than a\npack of enchantments!\u201d she stormed. \u201cEnough of this\nnonsense! If I hear you\u2019ve come anywhere near here\nagain, I\u2019ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor!\n\nYes, Weasley, from my own House!\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron went back to the common room. Harry\nhad just said, \u201cAt least Hermione\u2019s on Snape\u2019s tail,\u201d\n\nPage | 302 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nwhen the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and\nHermione came in.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Harry!\u201d she wailed. \u201cSnape came out and\nasked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for\nFlitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I\u2019ve only\njust got away, I don\u2019t know where Snape went.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s it then, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Harry said.\n\nThe other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes\nwere glittering.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going out of here tonight and I\u2019m going to try and\nget to the Stone first.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re mad!\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAfter what McGonagall\nand Snape have said? You\u2019ll be expelled!\u201d\n\n\u201cSO WHAT?\u201d Harry shouted. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand?\nIf Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort\u2019s coming\nback! Haven\u2019t you heard what it was like when he was\ntrying to take over? There won\u2019t be any Hogwarts to\nget expelled from! He\u2019ll flatten it, or turn it into a\nschool for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn\u2019t matter\nanymore, can\u2019t you see? D\u2019you think he\u2019ll leave you\nand your families alone if Gryffindor wins the House\nCup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well,\nI\u2019ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for\nVoldemort to find me there, it\u2019s only dying a bit later\nthan I would have, because I\u2019m never going over to\nthe Dark Side! I\u2019m going through that trapdoor\ntonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me!\nVoldemort killed my parents, remember?\u201d\n\nHe glared at them.\n\n\n\nPage | 303 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, Harry,\u201d said Hermione in a small voice.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll use the Invisibility Cloak,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt\u2019s just\nlucky I got it back.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut will it cover all three of us?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cAll \u2014 all three of us?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come off it, you don\u2019t think we\u2019d let you go\nalone?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d said Hermione briskly. \u201cHow do you\nthink you\u2019d get to the Stone without us? I\u2019d better go\nand look through my books, there might be\nsomething useful. ...\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot if I can help it,\u201d said Hermione grimly. \u201cFlitwick\ntold me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve\npercent on his exam. They\u2019re not throwing me out\nafter that.\u201d\n\nAfter dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in\nthe common room. Nobody bothered them; none of\nthe Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any\nmore, after all. This was the first night he hadn\u2019t been\nupset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her\nnotes, hoping to come across one of the\nenchantments they were about to try to break. Harry\nand Ron didn\u2019t talk much. Both of them were\nthinking about what they were about to do.\n\nSlowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.\n\n\u201cBetter get the cloak,\u201d Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan\nfinally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran\nupstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out the\n\nPage | 304 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\ncloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had\ngiven him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on\nFluffy \u2014 he didn\u2019t feel much like singing.\n\nHe ran back down to the common room.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it\ncovers all three of us \u2014 if Filch spots one of our feet\nwandering along on its own \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d said a voice from the corner of\nthe room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair,\nclutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he\u2019d\nbeen making another bid for freedom.\n\n\u201cNothing, Neville, nothing,\u201d said Harry, hurriedly\nputting the cloak behind his back.\n\nNeville stared at their guilty faces.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going out again,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not. Why don\u2019t\nyou go to bed, Neville?\u201d\n\nHarry looked at the grandfather clock by the door.\nThey couldn\u2019t afford to waste any more time, Snape\nmight even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go out,\u201d said Neville, \u201cyou\u2019ll be caught\nagain. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Harry, \u201cthis is\nimportant.\u201d\n\nBut Neville was clearly steeling himself to do\nsomething desperate.\n\n\n\nPage | 305 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t let you do it,\u201d he said, hurrying to stand in\nfront of the portrait hole. \u201cI\u2019ll \u2014 I\u2019ll fight you!\u201d\n\n\u201cNeville,\u201d Ron exploded, \u201cget away from that hole and\ndon\u2019t be an idiot \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you call me an idiot!\u201d said Neville. \u201cI don\u2019t\nthink you should be breaking any more rules! And\nyou were the one who told me to stand up to people!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but not to us,\u201d said Ron in exasperation.\n\n\u201cNeville, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nHe took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the\ntoad, who leapt out of sight.\n\n\u201cGo on then, try and hit me!\u201d said Neville, raising his\nfists. \u201cI\u2019m ready!\u201d\n\nHarry turned to Hermione.\n\n\u201cDo something,\u201d he said desperately.\n\nHermione stepped forward.\n\n\u201cNeville,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m really, really sorry about this.\u201d\nShe raised her wand.\n\n\u201cPetrificus Totalusl\u201d she cried, pointing it at Neville.\n\nNeville\u2019s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang\ntogether. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he\nstood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board.\n\nHermione ran to turn him over. Neville\u2019s jaws were\njammed together so he couldn\u2019t speak. Only his eyes\nwere moving, looking at them in horror.\n\n\n\nPage | 306 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ve you done to him?\u201d Harry whispered.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the full Body-Bind,\u201d said Hermione miserably.\n\u201cOh, Neville, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had to, Neville, no time to explain,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll understand later, Neville,\u201d said Ron as they\nstepped over him and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak.\n\nBut leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn\u2019t\nfeel like a very good omen. In their nervous state,\nevery statue\u2019s shadow looked like Filch, every distant\nbreath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on\nthem.\n\nAt the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs.\nNorris skulking near the top.\n\n\u201cOh, let\u2019s kick her, just this once,\u201d Ron whispered in\nHarry\u2019s ear, but Harry shook his head. As they\nclimbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her\nlamplike eyes on them, but didn\u2019t do anything.\n\nThey didn\u2019t meet anyone else until they reached the\nstaircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing\nhalfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would\ntrip.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he said suddenly as they climbed\ntoward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes.\n\u201cKnow you\u2019re there, even if I can\u2019t see you. Are you\nghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?\u201d\n\nHe rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at\nthem.\n\n\u201cShould call Filch, I should, if something\u2019s a-creeping\naround unseen.\u201d\n\nPage | 307 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nHarry had a sudden idea.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeeves,\u201d he said, in a hoarse whisper, \u201cthe Bloody\nBaron has his own reasons for being invisible.\u201d\n\nPeeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught\nhimself in time and hovered about a foot off the\nstairs.\n\n\u201cSo sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, sir,\u201d he said\ngreasily. \u201cMy mistake, my mistake \u2014 I didn\u2019t see you\n\u2014 of course I didn\u2019t, you\u2019re invisible \u2014 forgive old\nPeevsie his little joke, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have business here, Peeves,\u201d croaked Harry. \u201cStay\naway from this place tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will, sir, I most certainly will,\u201d said Peeves, rising up\nin the air again. \u201cHope your business goes well,\n\nBaron, I\u2019ll not bother you.\u201d\n\nAnd he scooted off.\n\n\u201cBrilliant, Harry!\u201d whispered Ron.\n\nA few seconds later, they were there, outside the\nthird-floor corridor \u2014 and the door was already ajar.\n\n\u201cWell, there you are,\u201d Harry said quietly, \u201cSnape\u2019s\nalready got past Fluffy.\u201d\n\nSeeing the open door somehow seemed to impress\nupon all three of them what was facing them.\nUnderneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two.\n\n\u201cIf you want to go back, I won\u2019t blame you,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou can take the cloak, I won\u2019t need it now.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d said Ron.\n\nPage | 308 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re coming,\u201d said Hermione.\n\nHarry pushed the door open.\n\nAs the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their\nears. All three of the dog\u2019s noses sniffed madly in their\ndirection, even though it couldn\u2019t see them.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that at its feet?\u201d Hermione whispered.\n\n\u201cLooks like a harp,\u201d said Ron. \u201cSnape must have left it\nthere.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must wake up the moment you stop playing,\u201d said\nHarry. \u201cWell, here goes ...\u201d\n\nHe put Hagrid\u2019s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn\u2019t\nreally a tune, but from the first note the beast\u2019s eyes\nbegan to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the\ndog\u2019s growls ceased \u2014 it tottered on its paws and fell\nto its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast\nasleep.\n\n\u201cKeep playing,\u201d Ron warned Harry as they slipped out\nof the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They\ncould feel the dog\u2019s hot, smelly breath as they\napproached the giant heads.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll be able to pull the door open,\u201d said Ron,\npeering over the dog\u2019s back. \u201cWant to go first,\nHermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right.\u201d Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully\nover the dog\u2019s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the\ntrapdoor, which swung up and open.\n\n\u201cWhat can you see?\u201d Hermione said anxiously.\n\nPage | 309 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNothing \u2014 just black \u2014 there\u2019s no way of climbing\ndown, we\u2019ll just have to drop.\u201d\n\nHarry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to\nget his attention and pointed at himself.\n\n\u201cYou want to go first? Are you sure?\u201d said Ron. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to\nHermione so she can keep him asleep.\u201d\n\nHarry handed the flute over. In the few seconds\u2019\nsilence, the dog growled and twitched, but the\nmoment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its\ndeep sleep.\n\nHarry climbed over it and looked down through the\ntrapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom.\n\nHe lowered himself through the hole until he was\nhanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at\nRon and said, \u201cIf anything happens to me, don\u2019t\nfollow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to\nDumbledore, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cSee you in a minute, I hope. ...\u201d\n\nAnd Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as\nhe fell down, down, down and \u2014\n\nFLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he\nlanded on something soft. He sat up and felt around,\nhis eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he\nwas sitting on some sort of plant.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201d he called up to the light the size of a\npostage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, \u201cit\u2019s a\nsoft landing, you can jump!\u201d\n\nPage | 310 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nRon followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to\nHarry.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this stuff?\u201d were his first words.\n\n\u201cDunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it\u2019s here\nto break the fall. Come on, Hermione!\u201d\n\nThe distant music stopped. There was a loud bark\nfrom the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She\nlanded on Harry\u2019s other side.\n\n\u201cWe must be miles under the school,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cLucky this plant thing\u2019s here, really,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cLucky\u201d shrieked Hermione. \u201cLook at you both!\u201d\n\nShe leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She\nhad to struggle because the moment she had landed,\nthe plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils\naround her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs\nhad already been bound tightly in long creepers\nwithout their noticing.\n\nHermione had managed to free herself before the\nplant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in\nhorror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off\nthem, but the more they strained against it, the\ntighter and faster the plant wound around them.\n\n\u201cStop moving!\u201d Hermione ordered them. \u201cI know what\nthis is \u2014 it\u2019s Devil\u2019s Snare!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m so glad we know what it\u2019s called, that\u2019s a\ngreat help,\u201d snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop\nthe plant from curling around his neck.\n\n\n\nPage | 311 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cShut up, I\u2019m trying to remember how to kill it!\u201d said\nHermione.\n\n\u201cWell, hurry up, I can\u2019t breathe!\u201d Harry gasped,\nwrestling with it as it curled around his chest.\n\n\u201cDevil\u2019s Snare, Devil\u2019s Snare ... what did Professor\nSprout say? \u2014 it likes the dark and the damp \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cSo light a fire!\u201d Harry choked.\n\n\u201cYes \u2014 of course \u2014 but there\u2019s no wood!\u201d Hermione\ncried, wringing her hands.\n\n\u201cHAVE YOU GONE MAD?\u201d Ron bellowed. \u201cARE YOU A\nWITCH OR NOT?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, right!\u201d said Hermione, and she whipped out her\nwand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of\nthe same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at\nthe plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it\nloosening its grip as it cringed away from the light\nand warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself\nfrom their bodies, and they were able to pull free.\n\n\u201cLucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\u201d\nsaid Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat\noff his face.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron, \u201cand lucky Harry doesn\u2019t lose his\nhead in a crisis \u2014 \u2018there\u2019s no wood,\u2019 honestly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis way,\u201d said Harry, pointing down a stone\npassageway, which was the only way forward.\n\nAll they could hear apart from their footsteps was the\ngentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The\npassageway sloped downward, and Harry was\nreminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the\n\nPage | 312 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nheart, he remembered the dragons said to be\nguarding vaults in the wizards\u2019 bank. If they met a\ndragon, a fully-grown dragon \u2014 Norbert had been bad\nenough ...\n\n\u201cCan you hear something?\u201d Ron whispered.\n\nHarry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to\nbe coming from up ahead.\n\n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s a ghost?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know ... sounds like wings to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s light ahead \u2014 I can see something moving.\u201d\n\nThey reached the end of the passageway and saw\nbefore them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling\narching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-\nbright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the\nroom. On the opposite side of the chamber was a\nheavy wooden door.\n\n\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll attack us if we cross the room?\u201d\nsaid Ron.\n\n\u201cProbably,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThey don\u2019t look very vicious,\nbut I suppose if they all swooped down at once . . .\nwell, there\u2019s no other choice ... I\u2019ll run.\u201d\n\nHe took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms,\nand sprinted across the room. He expected to feel\nsharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second,\nbut nothing happened. He reached the door\nuntouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked.\n\nThe other two followed him. They tugged and heaved\nat the door, but it wouldn\u2019t budge, not even when\nHermione tried her Alohomora Charm.\n\nPage | 313 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNow what?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese birds ... they can\u2019t be here just for decoration,\u201d\nsaid Hermione.\n\nThey watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering \u2014\nglittering?\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not birds!\u201d Harry said suddenly. \u201cThey\u2019re\nkeys Winged keys \u2014 look carefully. So that must\nmean ...\u201d he looked around the chamber while the\nother two squinted up at the flock of keys. "... yes \u2014\nlook! Broomsticks! We\u2019ve got to catch the key to the\ndoor!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there are hundreds of them!\u201d\n\nRon examined the lock on the door.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a big, old-fashioned one \u2014 probably\nsilver, like the handle.\u201d\n\nThey each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the\nair, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They\ngrabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted\nand dived so quickly it was almost impossible to\ncatch one.\n\nNot for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest\nSeeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting\nthings other people didn\u2019t. After a minute\u2019s weaving\nabout through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he\nnoticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it\nhad already been caught and stuffed roughly into the\nkeyhole.\n\n\u201cThat one!\u201d he called to the others. \u201cThat big one \u2014\nthere \u2014 no, there \u2014 with bright blue wings \u2014 the\nfeathers are all crumpled on one side.\u201d\n\nPage | 314 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nRon went speeding in the direction that Harry was\npointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off\nhis broom.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to close in on it!\u201d Harry called, not taking\nhis eyes off the key with the damaged wing. \u201cRon, you\ncome at it from above \u2014 Hermione, stay below and\nstop it from going down \u2014 and I\u2019ll try and catch it.\nRight, NOW!\u201d\n\nRon dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key\ndodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped\ntoward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a\nnasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone\nwith one hand. Ron and Hermione \u2019s cheers echoed\naround the high chamber.\n\nThey landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the\nkey struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock\nand turned \u2014 it worked. The moment the lock had\nclicked open, the key took flight again, looking very\nbattered now that it had been caught twice.\n\n\u201cReady?\u201d Harry asked the other two, his hand on the\ndoor handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open.\n\nThe next chamber was so dark they couldn\u2019t see\nanything at all. But as they stepped into it, light\nsuddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing\nsight.\n\nThey were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard,\nbehind the black chessmen, which were all taller than\nthey were and carved from what looked like black\nstone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were\nthe white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered\nslightly \u2014 the towering white chessmen had no faces.\n\n\u201cNow what do we do?\u201d Harry whispered.\n\nPage | 315 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Ron. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to play our\nway across the room.\u201d\n\n\n\nBehind the white pieces they could see another door.\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d said Hermione nervously.\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d said Ron, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to be\nchessmen.\u201d\n\nHe walked up to a black knight and put his hand out\nto touch the knights horse. At once, the stone sprang\nto life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight\nturned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.\n\n\u201cDo we \u2014 er \u2014 have to join you to get across?\u201d\n\nThe black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other\ntwo.\n\n\u201cThis needs thinking about. ...\u201d he said. \u201cI suppose\nwe\u2019ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces.\n\n\n\nHarry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron\nthink. Finally he said, \u201cNow, don\u2019t be offended or\nanything, but neither of you are that good at chess \u2014\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not offended,\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cJust tell us\nwhat to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and\nHermione, you go there instead of that castle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be a knight,\u201d said Ron.\n\nPage | 316 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nThe chessmen seemed to have been listening, because\nat these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned\ntheir backs on the white pieces and walked off the\nboard, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron,\nand Hermione took.\n\n\u201cWhite always plays first in chess,\u201d said Ron, peering\nacross the board. \u201cYes ... look ...\u201d\n\nA white pawn had moved forward two squares.\n\nRon started to direct the black pieces. They moved\nsilently wherever he sent them. Harry\u2019s knees were\ntrembling. What if they lost?\n\n\u201cHarry \u2014 move diagonally four squares to the right.\u201d\n\nTheir first real shock came when their other knight\nwas taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor\nand dragged him off the board, where he lay quite\nstill, facedown.\n\n\u201cHad to let that happen,\u201d said Ron, looking shaken.\n\u201cLeaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go\non.\u201d\n\nEvery time one of their men was lost, the white pieces\nshowed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp\nblack players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only\njust noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in\ndanger. He himself darted around the board, taking\nalmost as many white pieces as they had lost black\nones.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re nearly there,\u201d he muttered suddenly. \u201cLet me\nthink \u2014 let me think ...\u201d\n\nThe white queen turned her blank face toward him.\n\n\n\nPage | 317 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYes ...\u201d said Ron softly, \u201cit\u2019s the only way ... I\u2019ve got\nto be taken.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d Harry and Hermione shouted.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s chess!\u201d snapped Ron. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make\nsome sacrifices! I make my move and she\u2019ll take me \u2014\nthat leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want to stop Snape or not?\u201d\n\n\u201cRon \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cLook, if you don\u2019t hurry up, hell already have the\nStone!\u201d\n\nThere was no alternative.\n\n\u201cReady?\u201d Ron called, his face pale but determined.\n\u201cHere I go \u2014 now, don\u2019t hang around once you\u2019ve\nwon.\u201d\n\nHe stepped forward, and the white queen pounced.\nShe struck Ron hard across the head with her stone\narm, and he crashed to the floor \u2014 Hermione\nscreamed but stayed on her square \u2014 the white\nqueen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he\u2019d\nbeen knocked out.\n\nShaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.\n\nThe white king took off his crown and threw it at\nHarry\u2019s feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and\nbowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last\ndesperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione\ncharged through the door and up the next\npassageway.\n\nPage | 318 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat if he\u2019s \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be all right,\u201d said Harry, trying to convince\nhimself. \u201cWhat do you reckon\u2019s next?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had Sprout\u2019s, that was the Devil\u2019s Snare;\nFlitwick must\u2019ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall\ntransfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that\nleaves Quirrell\u2019s spell, and Snape\u2019s ...\u201d\n\nThey had reached another door.\n\n\u201cAll right?\u201d Harry whispered.\n\n\u201cGo on.\u201d\n\nHarry pushed it open.\n\nA disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of\nthem pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes\nwatering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a\ntroll even larger than the one they had tackled, out\ncold with a bloody lump on its head.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t have to fight that one,\u201d Harry\nwhispered as they stepped carefully over one of its\nmassive legs. \u201cCome on, I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\nHe pulled open the next door, both of them hardly\ndaring to look at what came next \u2014 but there was\nnothing very frightening in here, just a table with\nseven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a\nline.\n\n\u201cSnape\u2019s,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhat do we have to do?\u201d\n\nThey stepped over the threshold, and immediately a\nfire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn\u2019t\nordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same\n\nPage | 319 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\ninstant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading\nonward. They were trapped.\n\n\u201cLook!\u201d Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to\nthe bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it:\n\nDanger lies before you, while safety lies behind,\n\nTwo of us will help you, whichever you would find,\n\nOne among us seven will let you move ahead,\n\nAnother will transport the drinker back instead,\n\nTwo among our number hold only nettle wine,\n\nThree of us are killers, waiting hidden in line.\n\nChoose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,\n\nTo help you in your choice, we give you these clues\nfour:\n\nFirst, however slyly the poison tries to hide\n\nYou will always find some on nettle wine\u2019s left side;\n\nSecond, different are those who stand at either end,\n\nBut if you would move onward, neither is your friend;\n\nThird, as you see clearly, all are different size,\n\nNeither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;\n\nFourth, the second left and the second on the right\n\nAre twins once you taste them, though different at first\nsight\n\nPage | 320 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nHermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw\nthat she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like\ndoing.\n\n\u201cBrilliant,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cThis isn\u2019t magic \u2014 it\u2019s\nlogic \u2014 a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven\u2019t\ngot an ounce of logic, they\u2019d be stuck in here forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut so will we, won\u2019t we?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cEverything we need\nis here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison;\ntwo are wine; one will get us safely through the black\nfire, and one will get us back through the purple.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how do we know which to drink?\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me a minute.\u201d\n\nHermione read the paper several times. Then she\nwalked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to\nherself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her\nhands.\n\n\u201cGot it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe smallest bottle will get us\nthrough the black fire \u2014 toward the Stone.\u201d\n\nHarry looked at the tiny bottle.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only enough there for one of us,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s hardly one swallow.\u201d\n\nThey looked at each other.\n\n\u201cWhich one will get you back through the purple\nflames?\u201d\n\nHermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end\nof the line.\n\nPage | 321 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou drink that,\u201d said Harry. \u201cNo, listen, get back and\nget Ron. Grab brooms from the flying-key room,\nthey\u2019ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy \u2014\ngo straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to\nDumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold\nSnape off for a while, but I\u2019m no match for him,\nreally.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Harry \u2014 what if You-Know- Who\u2019s with him?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell \u2014 I was lucky once, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d said Harry,\npointing at his scar. \u201cI might get lucky again.\u201d\n\nHermione\u2019s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at\nHarry and threw her arms around him.\n\n\u201cHermionel\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry \u2014 you\u2019re a great wizard, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not as good as you,\u201d said Harry, very\nembarrassed, as she let go of him.\n\n\u201cMe!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cBooks! And cleverness! There\nare more important things \u2014 friendship and bravery\nand \u2014 oh Harry \u2014 be carefull\u201d\n\n\u201cYou drink first,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou are sure which is\nwhich, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cPositive,\u201d said Hermione. She took a long drink from\nthe round bottle at the end, and shuddered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not poison?\u201d said Harry anxiously.\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 but it\u2019s like ice.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuick, go, before it wears off.\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 322 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGood luck \u2014 take care \u2014 \u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cGO!\u201d\n\nHermione turned and walked straight through the\npurple fire.\n\nHarry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest\nbottle. He turned to face the black flames.\n\n\u201cHere I come,\u201d he said, and he drained the little bottle\nin one gulp.\n\nIt was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He\nput the bottle down and walked forward; he braced\nhimself, saw the black flames licking his body, but\ncouldn\u2019t feel them \u2014 for a moment he could see\nnothing but dark fire \u2014 then he was on the other\nside, in the last chamber.\n\nThere was already someone there \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t\nSnape. It wasn\u2019t even Voldemort.\n\n\n\nPage | 323 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE MAN WITH TWO FACES\n\nIt was Quirrell.\n\n\u201cYou\u201d gasped Harry.\n\nQuirrell smiled. His face wasn\u2019t twitching at all.\n\n\u201cMe,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cI wondered whether I\u2019d be\nmeeting you here, Potter.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I thought \u2014 Snape \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cSeverus?\u201d Quirrell laughed, and it wasn\u2019t his usual\nquivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. \u201cYes,\nSeverus does seem the type, doesn\u2019t he? So useful to\nhave him swooping around like an overgrown bat.\n\nNext to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-\nstuttering P-Professor Quirrell?\u201d\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t take it in. This couldn\u2019t be true, it\ncouldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cBut Snape tried to kill me!\u201d\n\nPage | 324 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, no, no. / tried to kill you. Your friend Miss\nGranger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed\nto set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She\nbroke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds\nand I\u2019d have got you off that broom. I\u2019d have managed\nit before then if Snape hadn\u2019t been muttering a\ncountercurse, trying to save you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSnape was trying to save me?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Quirrell coolly. \u201cWhy do you think\nhe wanted to referee your next match? He was trying\nto make sure I didn\u2019t do it again. Funny, really ... he\nneedn\u2019t have bothered. I couldn\u2019t do anything with\nDumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought\nSnape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he\ndid make himself unpopular . . . and what a waste of\ntime, when after all that, I\u2019m going to kill you tonight.\u201d\n\nQuirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin\nair and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the\nschool on Halloween like that, for all I knew you\u2019d\nseen me coming to look at what was guarding the\nStone.\u201d\n\n\u201c You let the troll in?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly. I have a special gift with trolls \u2014 you must\nhave seen what I did to the one in the chamber back\nthere? Unfortunately, while everyone else was\nrunning around looking for it, Snape, who already\nsuspected me, went straight to the third floor to head\nme off \u2014 and not only did my troll fail to beat you to\ndeath, that three-headed dog didn\u2019t even manage to\nbite Snape \u2019s leg off properly.\n\n\n\nPage | 325 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNow, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this\ninteresting mirror.\u201d\n\nIt was only then that Harry realized what was\nstanding behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised.\n\n\u201cThis mirror is the key to finding the Stone,\u201d Quirrell\nmurmured, tapping his way around the frame. \u201cTrust\nDumbledore to come up with something like this . . .\nbut he\u2019s in London ... I\u2019ll be far away by the time he\ngets back. ...\u201d\n\nAll Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell\ntalking and stop him from concentrating on the\nmirror.\n\n\u201cI saw you and Snape in the forest \u2014 \u201d he blurted out.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to\nlook at the back. \u201cHe was on to me by that time,\ntrying to find out how far I\u2019d got. He suspected me all\nalong. Tried to frighten me \u2014 as though he could,\nwhen I had Lord Voldemort on my side. ...\u201d\n\nQuirrell came back out from behind the mirror and\nstared hungrily into it.\n\n\u201cI see the Stone ... I\u2019m presenting it to my master ...\nbut where is it?\u201d\n\nHarry struggled against the ropes binding him, but\nthey didn\u2019t give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving\nhis whole attention to the mirror.\n\n\u201cBut Snape always seemed to hate me so much.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, he does,\u201d said Quirrell casually, \u201cheavens, yes.\nHe was at Hogwarts with your father, didn\u2019t you\n\n\n\nPage | 326 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nknow? They loathed each other. But he never wanted\nyou dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I heard you a few days ago, sobbing \u2014 I thought\nSnape was threatening you.\n\nFor the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across\nQuirrell\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d he said, \u201cI find it hard to follow my\nmaster\u2019s instructions \u2014 he is a great wizard and I am\nweak \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean he was there in the classroom with you?\u201d\nHarry gasped.\n\n\u201cHe is with me wherever I go,\u201d said Quirrell quietly. \u201cI\nmet him when I traveled around the world. A foolish\nyoung man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about\ngood and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong\nI was. There is no good and evil, there is only power,\nand those too weak to seek it. ... Since then, I have\nserved him faithfully, although I have let him down\nmany times. He has had to be very hard on me.\u201d\nQuirrell shivered suddenly. \u201cHe does not forgive\nmistakes easily. When I failed to steal the Stone from\nGringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me\n. . . decided he would have to keep a closer watch on\nme. ...\u201d\n\nQuirrell\u2019s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering\nhis trip to Diagon Alley \u2014 how could he have been so\nstupid? He\u2019d seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken\nhands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.\n\nQuirrell cursed under his breath.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand ... is the Stone inside the mirror?\nShould I break it?\u201d\n\nPage | 327 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nHarry\u2019s mind was racing.\n\n\n\nWhat I want more than anything else in the world at\nthe moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before\nQuirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see\nmy self finding it \u2014 which means I\u2019ll see where it\u2019s\nhidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing\nwhat I\u2019m up to?\n\nHe tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass\nwithout Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his\nankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell\nignored him. He was still talking to himself.\n\n\u201cWhat does this mirror do? How does it work? Help\nme, Master!\u201d\n\nAnd to Harry\u2019s horror, a voice answered, and the voice\nseemed to come from Quirrell himself.\n\n\u201cUse the boy ... Use the boy ...\u201d\n\nQuirrell rounded on Harry.\n\n\u201cYes \u2014 Potter \u2014 come here.\u201d\n\nHe clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding\nHarry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet.\n\n\u201cCome here,\u201d Quirrell repeated. \u201cLook in the mirror\nand tell me what you see.\u201d\n\nHarry walked toward him.\n\nI must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie\nabout what I see, that\u2019s all.\n\nQuirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in\nthe funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell\u2019s\n\nPage | 328 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nturban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the\nmirror, and opened them again.\n\nHe saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first.\nBut a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It\nput its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-\nred stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its\npocket \u2014 and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy\ndrop into his real pocket. Somehow \u2014 incredibly \u2014\nhe\u2019d gotten the Stone.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d said Quirrell impatiently. \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d\nHarry screwed up his courage.\n\n\u201cI see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,\u201d he\ninvented. \u201cI \u2014 I\u2019ve won the House Cup for Gryffindor.\u201d\n\nQuirrell cursed again.\n\n\u201cGet out of the way,\u201d he said. As Harry moved aside,\nhe felt the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone against his leg. Dare he\nmake a break for it?\n\nBut he hadn\u2019t walked five paces before a high voice\nspoke, though Quirrell wasn\u2019t moving his lips.\n\n\u201cHe lies ... He lies ...\u201d\n\n\u201cPotter, come back here!\u201d Quirrell shouted. \u201cTell me\nthe truth! What did you just see?\u201d\n\nThe high voice spoke again.\n\n\u201cLet me speak to him ... face-to-face. ...\u201d\n\n\u201cMaster, you are not strong enough!\u201d\n\n\u201cI have strength enough ... for this. ...\u201d\n\nPage | 329 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nHarry felt as if Devil\u2019s Snare was rooting him to the\nspot. He couldn\u2019t move a muscle. Petrified, he\nwatched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap\nhis turban. What was going on? The turban fell away.\nQuirrell\u2019s head looked strangely small without it.\n\nThen he turned slowly on the spot.\n\nHarry would have screamed, but he couldn\u2019t make a\nsound. Where there should have been a back to\nQuirrell\u2019s head, there was a face, the most terrible\nface Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with\nglaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter ...\u201d it whispered.\n\nHarry tried to take a step backward but his legs\nwouldn\u2019t move.\n\n\u201cSee what I have become?\u201d the face said. \u201cMere\nshadow and vapor ... I have form only when I can\nshare another\u2019s body . . . but there have always been\nthose willing to let me into their hearts and minds. ...\nUnicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks\n. . . you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the\nforest ... and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be\nable to create a body of my own. ... Now ... why don\u2019t\nyou give me that Stone in your pocket?\u201d\n\nSo he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into\nHarry\u2019s legs. He stumbled backward.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool,\u201d snarled the face. \u201cBetter save your\nown life and join me ... or you\u2019ll meet the same end as\nyour parents. ... They died begging me for mercy. ...\u201d\n\n\u201cLIAR!\u201d Harry shouted suddenly.\n\n\n\nPage | 330 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nQuirrell was walking backward at him, so that\nVoldemort could still see him. The evil face was now\nsmiling.\n\n\u201cHow touching ...\u201d it hissed. \u201cI always value bravery.\n\n... Yes, boy, your parents were brave. ... I killed your\nfather first, and he put up a courageous fight . . . but\nyour mother needn\u2019t have died ... she was trying to\nprotect you. ... Now give me the Stone, unless you\nwant her to have died in vain.\u201d\n\n\u201cNEVER!\u201d\n\nHarry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort\nscreamed \u201cSEIZE HIM!\u201d and the next second, Harry\nfelt Quirrell\u2019s hand close on his wrist. At once, a\nneedle-sharp pain seared across Harry\u2019s scar; his\nhead felt as though it was about to split in two; he\nyelled, struggling with all his might, and to his\nsurprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head\nlessened \u2014 he looked around wildly to see where\nQuirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain,\nlooking at his fingers \u2014 they were blistering before his\neyes.\n\n\u201cSeize him! SEIZE HIM!\u201d shrieked Voldemort again,\nand Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet,\nlanding on top of him, both hands around Harry\u2019s\nneck \u2014 Harry\u2019s scar was almost blinding him with\npain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.\n\n\u201cMaster, I cannot hold him \u2014 my hands \u2014 my\nhands!\u201d\n\nAnd Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground\nwith his knees, let go of his neck and stared,\nbewildered, at his own palms \u2014 Harry could see they\nlooked burned, raw, red, and shiny.\n\n\n\nPage | 331 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThen kill him, fool, and be done!\u201d screeched\nVoldemort.\n\nQuirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse,\nbut Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed\nQuirrell\u2019s face \u2014\n\n\u201cAAAARGH!\u201d\n\nQuirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and\nthen Harry knew: Quirrell couldn\u2019t touch his bare\nskin, not without suffering terrible pain \u2014 his only\nchance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in\nenough pain to stop him from doing a curse.\n\nHarry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm,\nand hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed\nand tried to throw Harry off \u2014 the pain in Harry\u2019s\nhead was building \u2014 he couldn\u2019t see \u2014 he could only\nhear Quirrell\u2019s terrible shrieks and Voldemort\u2019s yells\nof, \u201cKILL HIM! KILL HIM!\u201d and other voices, maybe in\nHarry\u2019s own head, crying, \u201cHarry! Harry!\u201d\n\nHe felt Quirrell\u2019s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew\nall was lost, and fell into blackness, down ... down ...\ndown ...\n\nSomething gold was glinting just above him. The\nSnitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too\nheavy.\n\nHe blinked. It wasn\u2019t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of\nglasses. How strange.\n\nHe blinked again. The smiling face of Albus\nDumbledore swam into view above him.\n\n\u201cGood afternoon, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\n\nPage | 332 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nHarry stared at him. Then he remembered: \u201cSir! The\nStone! It was Quirrell! He\u2019s got the Stone! Sir, quick \u2014\n\n\n\n\u201cCalm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the\ntimes,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cQuirrell does not have the\nStone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen who does? Sir, I \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me\nthrown out.\u201d\n\nHarry swallowed and looked around him. He realized\nhe must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed\nwith white linen sheets, and next to him was a table\npiled high with what looked like half the candy shop.\n\n\u201cTokens from your friends and admirers,\u201d said\nDumbledore, beaming. \u201cWhat happened down in the\ndungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a\ncomplete secret, so, naturally, the whole school\nknows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George\nWeasley were responsible for trying to send you a\ntoilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse\nyou. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be\nvery hygienic, and confiscated it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long have I been in here?\u201d\n\n\u201cThree days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger\nwill be most relieved you have come round, they have\nbeen extremely worried.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut sir, the Stone \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cI see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the\nStone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it\n\n\n\nPage | 333 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nfrom you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although\nyou were doing very well on your own, I must say.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got there? You got Hermione\u2019s owl?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I\nreached London than it became clear to me that the\nplace I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived\njust in time to pull Quirrell off you \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cIt was you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feared I might be too late.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou nearly were, I couldn\u2019t have kept him off the\nStone much longer \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cNot the Stone, boy, you \u2014 the effort involved nearly\nkilled you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid\nit had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.\u201d\n\n\u201cDestroyed?\u201d said Harry blankly. \u201cBut your friend \u2014\nNicolas Flamel \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you know about Nicolas?\u201d said Dumbledore,\nsounding quite delighted. \u201cYou did do the thing\nproperly, didn\u2019t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a\nlittle chat, and agreed it\u2019s all for the best.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that means he and his wife will die, won\u2019t they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in\norder and then, yes, they will die.\u201d\n\nDumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on\nHarry\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cTo one as young as you, I\u2019m sure it seems incredible,\nbut to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to\n\nPage | 334 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nbed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-\norganized mind, death is but the next great\nadventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a\nwonderful thing. As much money and life as you\ncould want! The two things most human beings would\nchoose above all \u2014 the trouble is, humans do have a\nknack of choosing precisely those things that are\nworst for them.\u201d\n\nHarry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed\na little and smiled at the ceiling.\n\n\u201cSir?\u201d said Harry. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking ... Sir \u2014 even if\nthe Stone\u2019s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cCall him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper\nname for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the\nthing itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir. Well, Voldemort\u2019s going to try other ways of\ncoming back, isn\u2019t he? I mean, he hasn\u2019t gone, has\nhe?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Harry, he has not. He is still out there\nsomewhere, perhaps looking for another body to\nshare ... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He\nleft Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his\nfollowers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while\nyou may only have delayed his return to power, it will\nmerely take someone else who is prepared to fight\nwhat seems a losing battle next time \u2014 and if he is\ndelayed again, and again, why, he may never return\nto power.\u201d\n\nHarry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made\nhis head hurt. Then he said, \u201cSir, there are some\nother things I\u2019d like to know, if you can tell me ...\nthings I want to know the truth about. ...\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 335 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe truth.\u201d Dumbledore sighed. \u201cIt is a beautiful and\nterrible thing, and should therefore be treated with\ngreat caution. However, I shall answer your questions\nunless I have a very good reason not to, in which case\nI beg you 11 forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell ... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother\nbecause she tried to stop him from killing me. But\nwhy would he want to kill me in the first place?\u201d\n\nDumbledore sighed very deeply this time.\n\n\u201cAlas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you.\n\nNot today. Not now. You will know, one day ... put it\nfrom your mind for now, Harry. When you are older . . .\nI know you hate to hear this . . . when you are ready,\nyou will know.\u201d\n\nAnd Harry knew it would be no good to argue.\n\n\u201cBut why couldn\u2019t Quirrell touch me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mother died to save you. If there is one thing\nVoldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn\u2019t\nrealize that love as powerful as your mother\u2019s for you\nleaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign ... to\nhave been loved so deeply, even though the person\nwho loved us is gone, will give us some protection\nforever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred,\ngreed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort,\ncould not touch you for this reason. It was agony to\ntouch a person marked by something so good.\u201d\n\nDumbledore now became very interested in a bird out\non the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his\neyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again,\nHarry said, \u201cAnd the Invisibility Cloak \u2014 do you know\nwho sent it to me?\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 336 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAh \u2014 your father happened to leave it in my\npossession, and I thought you might like it.\u201d\nDumbledore\u2019s eyes twinkled. \u201cUseful things ... your\nfather used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens\nto steal food when he was here.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s something else ...\u201d\n\n\u201cFire away.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuirrell said Snape \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor Snape, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, him \u2014 Quirrell said he hates me because he\nhated my father. Is that true?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike\nyourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did\nsomething Snape could never forgive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe saved his life.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes ...\u201d said Dumbledore dreamily. \u201cFunny, the way\npeople\u2019s minds work, isn\u2019t it? Professor Snape\ncouldn\u2019t bear being in your father\u2019s debt. ... I do\nbelieve he worked so hard to protect you this year\nbecause he felt that would make him and your father\neven. Then he could go back to hating your father\u2019s\nmemory in peace. ...\u201d\n\nHarry tried to understand this but it made his head\npound, so he stopped.\n\n\u201cAnd sir, there\u2019s one more thing ...\u201d\n\nPage | 337 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cJust the one?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHow did I get the Stone out of the mirror?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, now, I\u2019m glad you asked me that. It was one of\nmy more brilliant ideas, and between you and me,\nthat\u2019s saying something. You see, only one who\nwanted to find the Stone \u2014 find it, but not use it \u2014\nwould be able to get it, otherwise they\u2019d just see\nthemselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My\nbrain surprises even me sometimes. ... Now, enough\nquestions. I suggest you make a start on these\nsweets. Ah! Bertie Bott\u2019s Every Flavor Beans! I was\nunfortunate enough in my youth to come across a\nvomit-flavored one, and since then I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve\nrather lost my liking for them \u2014 but I think I\u2019ll be safe\nwith a nice toffee, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nHe smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his\nmouth. Then he choked and said, \u201cAlas! Ear wax!\u201d\n\nMadam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but\nvery strict.\n\n\u201cJust five minutes,\u201d Harry pleaded.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou let Professor Dumbledore in. ...\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, of course, that was the headmaster, quite\ndifferent. You need rest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go\non, Madam Pomfrey ...\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, very well,\u201d she said. \u201cBut five minutes only.\u201d\n\nAnd she let Ron and Hermione in.\n\nPage | 338 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHarryl\u201d\n\n\n\nHermione looked ready to fling her arms around him\nagain, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his\nhead was still very sore.\n\n\u201cOh, Harry, we were sure you were going to \u2014\nDumbledore was so worried \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole school\u2019s talking about it,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWhat\nreally happened?\u201d\n\nIt was one of those rare occasions when the true story\nis even more strange and exciting than the wild\nrumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the\nmirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione\nwere a very good audience; they gasped in all the\nright places, and when Harry told them what was\nunder Quirrell\u2019s turban, Hermione screamed out loud.\n\n\u201cSo the Stone\u2019s gone?\u201d said Ron finally. \u201cFlamel\u2019s just\ngoing to die?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that \u2014\nwhat was it? \u2014 \u2018to the well-organized mind, death is\nbut the next great adventure.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI always said he was off his rocker,\u201d said Ron,\nlooking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was.\n\n\u201cSo what happened to you two?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, I got back all right,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI brought\nRon round \u2014 that took a while \u2014 and we were\ndashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when\nwe met him in the entrance hall \u2014 he already knew \u2014\nhe just said, \u2018Harry\u2019s gone after him, hasn\u2019t he?\u2019 and\nhurtled off to the third floor.\u201d\n\nPage | 339 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cD\u2019you think he meant you to do it?\u201d said Ron.\n\u201cSending you your fathers cloak and everything?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Hermione exploded, \u201cif he did \u2014 I mean to say\n\u2014 that\u2019s terrible \u2014 you could have been killed.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d said Harry thoughtfully. \u201cHe\u2019s a funny\nman, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give\nme a chance. I think he knows more or less\neverything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he\nhad a pretty good idea we were going to try, and\ninstead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to\nhelp. I don\u2019t think it was an accident he let me find\nout how the mirror worked. It\u2019s almost like he thought\nI had the right to face Voldemort if I could. ...\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, Dumbledore\u2019s off his rocker, all right,\u201d said\nRon proudly. \u201cListen, you\u2019ve got to be up for the end-\nof-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and\nSlytherin won, of course \u2014 you missed the last\nQuidditch match, we were steamrollered by\nRavenclaw without you \u2014 but the food\u2019ll be good.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT,\u201d she\nsaid firmly.\n\n\n\n\u2022k k k\n\n\n\nAfter a good night\u2019s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to\nnormal.\n\n\u201cI want to go to the feast,\u201d he told Madam Pomfrey as\nshe straightened his many candy boxes. \u201cI can, can\u2019t\nI?\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 340 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to\ngo,\u201d she said sniffily, as though in her opinion\nProfessor Dumbledore didn\u2019t realize how risky feasts\ncould be. \u201cAnd you have another visitor.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, good,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWho is it?\u201d\n\nHagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual\nwhen he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be\nallowed. He sat down next to Harry, took one look at\nhim, and burst into tears.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2014 all \u2014 my \u2014 ruddy \u2014 fault!\u201d he sobbed, his\nface in his hands. \u201cI told the evil git how ter get past\nFluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn\u2019t\nknow, an\u2019 I told him! Yeh could\u2019ve died! All fer a\ndragon egg! I\u2019ll never drink again! I should be chucked\nout an\u2019 made ter live as a Muggle!\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking\nwith grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into\nhis beard. \u201cHagrid, he\u2019d have found out somehow,\nthis is Voldemort we\u2019re talking about, he\u2019d have found\nout even if you hadn\u2019t told him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeh could\u2019ve died!\u201d sobbed Hagrid. \u201cAn\u2019 don\u2019 say the\nname!\u201d\n\n\u201cVOLDEMORT!\u201d Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so\nshocked, he stopped crying. \u201cI\u2019ve met him and I\u2019m\ncalling him by his name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we\nsaved the Stone, it\u2019s gone, he can\u2019t use it. Have a\nChocolate Frog, I\u2019ve got loads. ...\u201d\n\nHagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and\nsaid, \u201cThat reminds me. I\u2019ve got yeh a present.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a stoat sandwich, is it?\u201d said Harry\nanxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle.\n\nPage | 341 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter\nfix it. \u2019Course, he shoulda sacked me instead \u2014\nanyway, got y eh this ...\u201d\n\nIt seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book.\nHarry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard\nphotographs. Smiling and waving at him from every\npage were his mother and father.\n\n\u201cSent owls off ter all yer parents\u2019 old school friends,\naskin\u2019 fer photos ... knew yeh didn\u2019 have any ... d\u2019yeh\nlike it?\u201d\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t speak, but Hagrid understood.\n\nHarry made his way down to the end-of-year feast\nalone that night. He had been held up by Madam\nPomfrey\u2019s fussing about, insisting on giving him one\nlast checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It\nwas decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and\nsilver to celebrate Slytherin \u2019s winning the House Cup\nfor the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing\nthe Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the\nHigh Table.\n\nWhen Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and\nthen everybody started talking loudly at once. He\nslipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the\nGryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that\npeople were standing up to look at him.\n\nFortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The\nbabble died away.\n\n\u201cAnother year gone!\u201d Dumbledore said cheerfully.\n\n\u201cAnd I must trouble you with an old man\u2019s wheezing\nwaffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious\nfeast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads\nare all a little fuller than they were . . . you have the\nPage | 342 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nwhole summer ahead to get them nice and empty\nbefore next year starts. ...\n\n\u201cNow, as I understand it, the House Cup here needs\nawarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place,\nGryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in\nthird, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two;\nRavenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and\nSlytherin, four hundred and seventy- two.\u201d\n\nA storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the\nSlytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging\nhis goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight.\n\n\u201cYes, yes, well done, Slytherin,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\u201cHowever, recent events must be taken into account.\u201d\n\nThe room went very still. The Slytherins\u2019 smiles faded\na little.\n\n\u201cAhem,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI have a few last-minute\npoints to dish out. Let me see. Yes ...\n\n\u201cFirst \u2014 to Mr. Ronald Weasley ...\u201d\n\nRon went purple in the face; he looked like a radish\nwith a bad sunburn.\n\n"... for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has\nseen in many years, I award Gryffindor House fifty\npoints.\u201d\n\nGryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling;\nthe stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be\nheard telling the other prefects, \u201cMy brother, you\nknow! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall\u2019s\ngiant chess set!\u201d\n\nAt last there was silence again.\n\nPage | 343 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSecond \u2014 to Miss Hermione Granger . . . for the use of\ncool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House\nfifty points.\u201d\n\nHermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly\nsuspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up\nand down the table were beside themselves \u2014 they\nwere a hundred points up.\n\n\u201cThird \u2014 to Mr. Harry Potter ...\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\nThe room went deadly quiet. "... for pure nerve and\noutstanding courage, I award Gryffindor House sixty\npoints.\u201d\n\nThe din was deafening. Those who could add up while\nyelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now\nhad four hundred and seventy-two points \u2014 exactly\nthe same as Slytherin. They had tied for the House\nCup \u2014 if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one\nmore point.\n\nDumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell\nsilent.\n\n\u201cThere are all kinds of courage,\u201d said Dumbledore,\nsmiling. \u201cIt takes a great deal of bravery to stand up\nto our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our\nfriends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville\nLongbottom.\u201d\n\nSomeone standing outside the Great Hall might well\nhave thought some sort of explosion had taken place,\nso loud was the noise that erupted from the\nGryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up\nto yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock,\ndisappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He\nhad never won so much as a point for Gryffindor\nbefore. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs\nand pointed at Malfoy, who couldn\u2019t have looked more\nPage | 344 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nstunned and horrified if he\u2019d just had the Body-Bind\nCurse put on him.\n\n\u201cWhich means,\u201d Dumbledore called over the storm of\napplause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were\ncelebrating the downfall of Slytherin, \u201cwe need a little\nchange of decoration.\u201d\n\nHe clapped his hands. In an instant, the green\nhangings became scarlet and the silver became gold;\nthe huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering\nGryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking\nProfessor McGonagall\u2019s hand, with a horrible, forced\nsmile. He caught Harry\u2019s eye and Harry knew at once\nthat Snape \u2019s feelings toward him hadn\u2019t changed one\njot. This didn\u2019t worry Harry. It seemed as though life\nwould be back to normal next year, or as normal as it\never was at Hogwarts.\n\nIt was the best evening of Harry\u2019s life, better than\nwinning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out\nmountain trolls ... he would never, ever forget tonight.\n\nHarry had almost forgotten that the exam results\nwere still to come, but come they did. To their great\nsurprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks;\nHermione, of course, had the best grades of the first\nyears. Even Neville scraped through, his good\nHerbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions\none. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as\nstupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he\nhad passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you\ncouldn\u2019t have everything in life.\n\nAnd suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their\ntrunks were packed, Neville\u2019s toad was found lurking\nin a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all\nstudents, warning them not to use magic over the\nholidays (\u201cI always hope they\u2019ll forget to give us\nPage | 345 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nthese,\u201d said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to\ntake them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across\nthe lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express;\ntalking and laughing as the countryside became\ngreener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott\u2019s Every Flavor\nBeans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off\ntheir wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats;\npulling into platform nine and three-quarters at\nKing\u2019s Cross station.\n\nIt took quite a while for them all to get off the\nplatform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket\nbarrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and\nthrees so they didn\u2019t attract attention by all bursting\nout of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.\n\n\u201cYou must come and stay this summer,\u201d said Ron,\n\u201cboth of you \u2014 I\u2019ll send you an owl.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI\u2019ll need something to look\nforward to.\u201d\n\nPeople jostled them as they moved forward toward the\ngateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them\ncalled:\n\n\u201cBye, Harry!\u201d\n\n\u201cSee you, Potter!\u201d\n\n\u201cStill famous,\u201d said Ron, grinning at him.\n\n\u201cNot where I\u2019m going, I promise you,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway\ntogether.\n\n\u201cThere he is, Mom, there he is, look!\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 346 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\nIt was Ginny Weasley, Ron\u2019s younger sister, but she\nwasn\u2019t pointing at Ron.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter!\u201d she squealed. \u201cLook, Mom! I can see\n\u201cBe quiet, Ginny, and it\u2019s rude to point.\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley smiled down at them.\n\n\u201cBusy year?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cVery,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThanks for the fudge and the\nsweater, Mrs. Weasley.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it was nothing, dear.\u201d\n\n\u201cReady, are you?\u201d\n\nIt was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still\nmustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry,\ncarrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary\npeople. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley,\nlooking terrified at the very sight of Harry.\n\n\u201cYou must be Harry\u2019s family!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley.\n\n\u201cIn a manner of speaking,\u201d said Uncle Vernon. \u201cHurry\nup, boy, we haven\u2019t got all day.\u201d He walked away.\n\nHarry hung back for a last word with Ron and\nHermione.\n\n\u201cSee you over the summer, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cHope you have \u2014 er \u2014 a good holiday,\u201d said\nHermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon,\nshocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.\n\n\n\nPage | 347 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, I will,\u201d said Harry, and they were surprised at\nthe grin that was spreading over his face. \u201c They don\u2019t\nknow we\u2019re not allowed to use magic at home. I\u2019m\ngoing to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer...\u201d\n\n\n\nPage | 348 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K.
